As one of the largest non-governmental organizations in the country, Pratham focuses on high-quality, low-cost, and replicable interventions to address gaps in the education system. Established in 1995 to provide education to children in the slums of Mumbai, Pratham has grown both in scope and geographical coverage. Pratham means 'first' in Sanskrit. True to its name, it is the first major organization to achieve lasting, wide-scale success in India's educational landscape. This has been made possible due to various policies and strategies adopted by the organization. The mission to improve the quality of education in India and ensure that all children not only attend but also thrive in school is being accomplished by working in collaboration with the government, local communities, parents, teachers, volunteers, and civil society members. Our programs aim to supplement rather than replace governmental efforts. They are implemented on a large scale to not only reach as many children as possible, but also to create an adoptable demonstration model for state governments. Pratham\u2019s strategies reconfigure teaching methodologies, break down traditional tactics,\nand challenge the current rote learning mechanisms in our schools. Our programs are innovative and outcome-driven. In its early years Pratham developed innovative teaching-learning approaches, materials, and measurement methods. In 2005, we pioneered a nationwide survey of schooling and learning that has had a major impact on national and international policy discussions. Pratham has worked to develop low-cost, replicable models that can easily spread and be adopted by other organizations. Thousands of volunteers work with Pratham to implement learning interventions at the grassroots level. These volunteers are mobilized, trained, and monitored by the Pratham team. They are also provided with teaching-learning material and books developed by Pratham. Not only does this ensure more effective implementation of the programs, but it also helps to build an infrastructure focused on providing quality education to children. All programs are designed to ensure that learning levels in schools and communities increase, education reaches all children who are in school or unable to use school facilities, and youth get well trained for job opportunities. Testing tools are also developed by the Pratham team to check the learning levels of children so as to determine the course of action best suited to each child and to assess impact of our programs. Over the years, Pratham's advocacy in the education sector has become well recognized and regarded. The Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) has become an important input in the education policies of both the central and state governments with several state governments using \n\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Us\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Pratham  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBoard  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLeadership  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPartners  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tPrograms\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEducation  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVocational Training   \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnnual Status of Education Report  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPratham Council For Vulnerable Children  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCovid Response  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLearning Readiness & Catch Up  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLessons from the Pandemic  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tGet Involved\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJob Opportunities  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInternships  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tDelhi Office\t\t\t\t\t\t \nB- 4/59, Safdarjung Enclave\n1st Floor, New Delhi - 110 029\nEmail: info@pratham.org\nContact number: 01141651638\n\n\t\t Mumbai Office \nY.B.

With almost all children in school, the critical question facing the country is \u2013 are children learning? Since 2005, ASER - the Annual Status of Education Report - has attempted to answer this question. Facilitated by Pratham, ASER is a nation wide household survey that reaches a representative sample of children in every rural district in India. Over 600,000 children from more than 300,000 households are reached every year. A set of basic reading and arithmetic tasks are administered one on one to each sampled child. In 2018, ASER visited 596 districts across the country. Sample: ASER reading and arithmetic tool Over ten years of data from the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) point to three key facts: Here is a table from ASER 2018 that shows reading levels for Std III to V. Not only do we see a large proportion of children at low levels of reading, but the variation in each grade is wide. For example: In Std V, while 50% of all children can read Std II level text (or even higher), the rest are not yet at Std II level. Close to 18% children are only able to recognize letters or yet to acquire that skill. 13% can read simple words but not sentences and another 19% are just about reading text at Std I level. This situation presents a huge challenge to any teacher. What should a teacher teach? And to whom? In a typical Indian classroom, the Std V teacher teaches from the Std V textbook and thus only the \u201ctop of the class\u201d benefits from her teaching. ASER 2018: % Children in primary school who can read at different levels\nAll India all rural districts:\nRepresentative sample of all children from household survey % Children in govt schools in Std III who can at least do subtraction: Selected States ASER 2018  The ASER 2018 graph on the left shows the proportion of Std III children enrolled in government schools who can at least do a numerical two digit subtraction problem with borrowing. (This kind of problem is usually found in Std II math textbooks in states). The All India figure indicates that approximately 21% of children can do this task correctly. However there is wide variation across the country with stats like Kerala, Himachal Pradesh or Punjab where more than 40% children can do this correctly to states like Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh where this figure is lower than 15%. If we consider these levels as a proxy for the proportion of children who are at grade level in Std III, we can see that a substantial jump is required to help children get close to grade level expectations. Click here to access. Over the last fifteen years, Pratham has evolved a solution called Teaching at the Right Level (TaRL) which enables children to acquire foundational skills, like reading and arithmetic quickly. Regardless of age or grade, teaching starts at the level of the child. This is what is meant by \u201cTeaching at the Right level\u201d. The TaRL method developed by Pratham was originally designed keeping in mind children who have already reached Std. III, IV or V but still have not acquired basic skills. The focus is on helping children with basic reading, understanding, expressing themselves as well as arithmetic skills. These are foundational building blocks that help a child to move forward. Studies have shown that once acquired these capabilities endure over time. TaRL is an effective and low-cost strategy that helps children to \u201ccatch up\u201d in a short period of time. Children, who are 7 or 8 and older and have been in school for a few years, can \u201cpick up\u201d quickly. 2.\u00a0Children\u2019s groups are made according to the basic assessment. Available teachers or instructors allocated to facilitate group activities and to guide children\u2019s work.  \n1. Simple one-on-one assessment done to group Std. III, IV and V children by level rather than by grade. 4. Similar assessment used for tracking children\u2019s progress, periodically and to guide onsite monitoring. 3. For each group there are a set of activities and materials appropriate for their level.\n \nChildren learn in groups and also individually. Teachers or instructors do activities with groups.  As children make progress they move into the next group. 1. Simple one-on-one assessment done to group Std.

To be effective, the \u201cTeaching at the Right Level\u201d approach needs to be embedded in a larger eco-system whose elements are aligned to support and ensure learning for all children. Here are the main features of the school system that need to be changed to ensure that learning for all is possible. Today Pratham\u2019s \u201cTaRL\u201d approach is implemented in two ways \u2013 directly by Pratham instructors through \u201cLearning Camps\u201d or as part of a Pratham-government partnership programs where government teachers implement TaRL as part of the school day. In the direct model, Pratham instructors run \u201cLearning Camps\u201d, 30-50 days of instruction (3 to 5 camps of 10 days each), for about 3 hours a day. In the partnership model, government teachers use this approach over a longer period in the school year (four to six months) with dedicated time for 1-2 hours a day. Here is an example of learning improvement seen in the 2017-18 Pratham-Goverment of Karnataka Partnership Program for Std. IV & V: In the 2018-19 school year, Pratham is partnering with several state governments to help children acquire foundational skills. These states include Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Jammu and Kashmir and in some districts for Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand and West Bengal. \n\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Us\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Pratham  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBoard  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLeadership  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPartners  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tPrograms\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEducation  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVocational Training   \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnnual Status of Education Report  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPratham Council For Vulnerable Children  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCovid Response  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLearning Readiness & Catch Up  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLessons from the Pandemic  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tGet Involved\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJob Opportunities  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInternships  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tDelhi Office\t\t\t\t\t\t \nB- 4/59, Safdarjung Enclave\n1st Floor, New Delhi - 110 029\nEmail: info@pratham.org\nContact number: 01141651638\n\n\t\t Mumbai Office \nY.B.

Since 2005, more than 90% of all children in the 6 to 14 age group have been enrolled in school. By 2010 this figure had reached 96% or more and remained that way till the pandemic. While the problem of every child in school has been largely solved, the goal of every child learning well is still far from being achieved. ASER reports from 2005 to 2018 indicate a pattern of persistently low learning levels even for basic skills like reading and arithmetic. Even as late as 2018, the ASER survey showed that half of the sampled children in Grade 5 are struggling to read text at a Grade 2 level. Pratham\u2019s efforts for the last two decades have been largely focussed on finding a solution for this learning crisis Over the years, the approach that has evolved is called Teaching at the Right Level or TaRL. \nFrom 2012 to 2017, Pratham had been working directly on helping children in Grade 3 and above, catch up on basic reading and arithmetic. This teaching-learning approach is called Teaching at the Right Level (TaRL). Targeted at children enrolled in government schools in Grades 3 to 5, these intensive bursts of activity (30-50 days or 3 to 5 camps of 10 days each) ensured that by the end of the last camp more than 70% of children were able to read simple texts fluently and confidently do basic arithmetic operations. Building on the successful experiences with the TaRL Learning Camps, by 2017-18, we took several more steps. These steps were based on questions like: The overarching challenge was how to durably change the learning situation in a village or urban community such that at least basic skills or foundational literacy and numeracy was taken care of. In 2018, we decided that we should work for three to five years in the communities where we worked \u201cdirectly\u201d. (Direct interventions are those in which full-time Pratham team members work directly with schools and communities, children and teachers.) We felt it was possible to work towards the goal of all children reading and doing basic arithmetic. Not only could we support children to learn and thrive but also with the help of local people, create engaging learning environments in the community. To continue to innovate and evolve, we started the multi-year \u201cHamara Gaon\u201d (Our Village/Our Community) intervention. The three-year goals included ensuring that: The overall objective of Hamara Gaon was to understand how in a period of three to five years a village could be enabled in terms of ensuring basic foundations of learning for every child at least for the elementary school age group. We also envisaged Hamara Gaon to be the active laboratory where methods of teaching-learning and materials could be developed, as well as become the locations where impacts on learning could be measured and effectiveness of the approach could be shared more widely with other partners and governments. The disruptions and discontinuities due to the COVID-19 pandemic led to many changes in the way that we interacted and engaged with the Hamara Gaon communities. Here are some key elements of our renewed efforts: Youth Volunteers A stronger push for \u201ccatch up\u201d is needed to help children recover from the learning losses of the last two years. During the pandemic, we were able to successfully mobilize community volunteers who ran promising TaRL \u201ccatch up\u201d learning camps in communities. Thus, along with work with teachers and schools, youth volunteers will continue to play an ongoing role in supporting children\u2019s learning. Mothers\u2019 Groups During the lockdown, we engaged directly with families of young children (pre-school age and those who were of Grade 1 and 2 age). We sent them activities to do with their children via phone messages (SMS and WhatsApp). We also connected regularly with families via phone calls for follow up and feedback. We saw mothers participating actively with their children. Young mothers were encouraged to form their own mothers' groups in the neighbourhood and get together regularly to do activities with their children. In the current version of Hamara Gaon, mothers and mother\u2019s groups have emerged as a vital part of young children\u2019s learning journeys. In July 2020, the Government of India launched its New Education Policy (NEP 2020).\u00a0 The document strongly recommends that acquisition of foundational literacy and numeracy in primary grades should have the highest national priority. For us, too, in the next two-three years, it is very important to demonstrate that these national goals are achievable in our local Hamara Gaon communities. Hamara Gaon today\u00a0 The Hamara Gaon program is usually implemented in a cluster of 25 communities (either villages or urban communities. A team of 5-6 Pratham team members are responsible for transforming this community. In 2022-23, the program was operational in 5192 communities and reached ~3,86,000 children.

Fostering appropriate developmental abilities of children at this crucial stage has been closely associated with improved outcomes, such as better preparedness for school, enhanced retention and all round development of the child. There is clearly a need to look at the 3 to 8 year old age group in India very closely.The Annual Status of Education Report (ASER 2018) on \u2018Young Children\u2019 shows that across India, 28.8% of children at age 3 do not attend any government or private preschool. This report also shows a wide variation in enrollment patterns across states. While the National Education Policy 2020 has laid out that the appropriate age for a child to enter grade 1 is 6 years of age, a significant number of children in government schools are age 5 or below. The data also indicated that children who enter school before the appropriate age of 6 do comparatively worse than their older counterparts in the same grade.\u00a0 \u00a0 Some distinguishing elements of Pratham\u2019s approach towards Early Childhood Education are: This instructor or teacher is a local community member, who has a strong understanding of the local context, which helps her effectively interact with children and engage with parents. The content is based on the child\u2019s immediate surroundings. Activities are conducted with children in varying setups \u2013 big groups, small groups and individually \u2013 and are supported with contextualized print and play material such as flash cards, story books, story cards, picture cards, beads, clay and locally available objects of daily use. Children are regularly assessed by instructors through simple activities and observations. Indicators for assessment are such that they are easy to observe, measure and communicate. The findings of these periodic assessments help instructors track children\u2019s progress and are regularly communicated to parents as an engagement tool. Mothers are also engaged through periodic meetings, creation of mothers\u2019 groups in the community and individual home visits. Mother engagement includes discussions, games and material creation and distribution. Pratham\u2019s work in Early Childhood Education began over 25 years ago with community-based preschool centres in Mumbai, which were run by local young women. Over the years, the program has evolved to include multiple delivery models to suit the dynamic contexts and needs of different geographies across India. Today, Pratham\u2019s ECE program is implemented in the following ways: DIRECT APPROACH:\u00a0 Anganwadi Support: This involves mobilization of community volunteers to provide daily instructional activities to children in anganwadis, form and work with mothers\u2019 groups and conduct community events. Pratham provides training and on-site monitoring support to volunteers.\u00a0Pratham\u2019s anganwadi support model follows a \u2018teaching in, reaching out\u2019 approach where efforts are made to engage children both within the institution (i.e. anganwadis) as well as outside it \u2013 at home and in the community.\u00a0 Pratham partners with ICDS and provides support to anganwadi workers across the block.\u00a0Pratham provides content, material, and demonstrates appropriate teaching practices and supports anganwadi workers in carrying out learning activities with children.\u00a0 Outside the anganwadi, Pratham engages mothers in the community and encourages them to participate in their child\u2019s learning process. This is done by forming mothers\u2019 groups in every community and facilitating regular meetings where Pratham staff and community volunteers demonstrate learning activities for them to conduct with their children at home and discuss any issues related to their children\u2019s education.\u00a0 Pratham also conducts school readiness melas in every community before the start of each school year for children about to enter grade 1. This mela encourages a mother and child to come together to participate in the learning focused activities.\u00a0 See school readiness melas in action in Rajasthan and Assam. GOVERNMENT PARTNERSHIP APPROACH:\u00a0 In formal government partnerships, Pratham partners with the state/district-level government to strengthen existing government infrastructure and resources for the quality provision of Early Childhood Education, either in Anganwadi centres or in pre-primary classes and early grades within government schools. Pratham and the government jointly work towards the development of the program, including designing curriculum and material, training government personnel and supporting other key elements such as on-site monitoring and mentoring, measurement and assessment and periodic reviews. Pratham views these government partnerships as a key pathway to achieving systemic change.\u00a0 Pratham has an observation- and activity-based approach to measuring children\u2019s progress under the Early Childhood Education program. Assessment under the program is done in two ways: This information is communicated to parents via a Child Report Card with easy-to-understand grading indicators. Pratham uses this as an effective engagement tool for parents. Used to understand the impact of Pratham interventions on preschool children enrolled in Balwadis/Anganwadis as compared to children in the same areas who are not part of Pratham interventions. Data is collected and can be used for analysis to understand overall status of learning gains through Pratham programs. This instructor or teacher is a local community member, who has a strong understanding of the local context, which helps her effectively interact with children and engage with parents. The content is based on the child\u2019s immediate surroundings. Activities are conducted with children in varying setups \u2013 big groups, small groups and individually \u2013 and are supported with contextualized print and play material such as flash cards, story books, story cards, picture cards, beads, clay and locally available objects of daily use.

However, ASER and other surveys show that a significant proportion of these children complete primary schooling without acquiring foundational reading and arithmetic skills, and therefore, are unable to cope with subsequent curricular expectations. One of Pratham\u2019s key goals is to enable such children acquire basic reading and arithmetic skills, quickly and sustainably, so that they can meaningfully benefit from further education opportunities. Pratham has developed the CAMaL pedagogy, which stands for Combined Activities for Maximised Learning, to help children \u201ccatch up\u201d. CAMaL is a child-centered pedagogy that builds on the Teaching at the Right Level (TaRL) approach, pioneered by Pratham, that uses instructions and activities tailored and aligned to the learning level of the child. At Pratham, we believe that a combination of activities helps children engage and learn. For example, reading aloud, participating in discussions on what they have read or heard, activities with phonetic charts, playing a variety of word games, expressing their own views orally and on paper \u2013 are all part of the process of learning to read. We do activities with children in large groups, small groups and individually.

As mentioned above, children are grouped by their learning levels, using the TaRL approach, and targeted reading and arithmetic activities are conducted for 2-3 hours a day. The teachers are trained, mentored and supported by a cadre of Key Resource Persons (KRPs), typically comprising block and cluster level officials as well as Pratham staff. The KRPs, who we consider as \u201cLeaders of Practice\u201d, are a critical pillar of Pratham\u2019s government partnership programs. Pratham staff trains the KRPs and supports them through the practice classes they are required to run before they train teachers. The practice classes, based on the learning by doing philosophy, enable the KRPs to see first-hand the efficacy and simplicity of the CAMaL pedagogy and equip them to subsequently support and guide the teachers. In addition to mentoring and support, periodic data-based reviews are conducted at different levels of the education system to help assess progress and identify improvement strategies.

Over the last decade or so, girls have dropped out of school disproportionately due to factors like early marriage, chores at home and cost of education [National Family Health Survey-5 (2019-21) data]. Pratham\u2019s experience indicates that once a learner has dropped out of school, it is near impossible for them to find their way back. While India has open schooling opportunities, there is lack of awareness, accessibility, adequate motivation and support for a student to use open schooling as a way to continue their education. Fewer people progressing for higher studies, low quality secondary education, an ever-increasing demand of a skilled labour force reinforces the need for an effective intervention in the secondary education space. A secondary school certificate is a prerequisite for entry into higher education, skill apprenticeship and for promotion in jobs. Pratham believes that by making education accessible and closer to home, it is possible to overcome logistical and social challenges and begin to bridge the gender gap in learning and education. Understanding the importance of secondary education, especially Grade 10, Pratham has deployed a focused intervention, the Second Chance program, to enable young girls and women to complete their secondary schooling and forge strong pathways for the future. Pratham's Second Chance program focuses on providing school dropouts, especially young girls and women, another chance at education. Second Chance aims to support those who could not complete their secondary education. The program focuses on completion of Grade 10. The academic certificate that they receive opens the door for further opportunities for lifelong learning and growth. The Second Chance program uses innovative teaching methods, to provide accessible learning opportunities very close to where the students live. Currently, the Second Chance program is operational in Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Rajasthan, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka.

The program runs in two phases. The first phase is called the Foundation Course (FC) which lasts for 3-4 months and focuses on basic foundational concepts of subjects like English, Mathematics, Language (state-specific), Science and Home Science. Assessment in the form of a pre-test at the onset of FC and post-test at the end of FC are conducted to track the learning levels of students and their growth during the course. During this phase, life skills-focused activities are also conducted with the learners, concentrating on enhancement of communication, decision-making and critical thinking skills. After the Foundation Course, students move to the Main Course which focuses on helping learners prepare for the Board-mandated curriculum. The progress during the Main Course is tracked through internal assessments. Interactive methods such as activity-based learning, group work and an emphasis on self-learning are the highlights of the course. The Main Course formally ends with the students appearing for the Board Examination. Additionally, the program delivers non-academic modules focused on providing learners exposure to available opportunities after Grade 10.

Digital devices and content placed directly in the hands of children providing them with opportunities and choices to learn on their own. Community based children\u2019s groups engage in choice-based learning and are guided by the coaches and youth members in the communities. The communities are organized to facilitate and support the learning activities and assessments. The program aims to create an open learning mechanism enabling children and youth to prepare for school, work, and life. The program has been designed on the premise that children can be motivated to learn on their own. Children learn on tablets and do projects or conduct activities (e.g. role plays, playing games)\u00a0and then present what they have learned either in front of a live audience of parents or on a video. Our internal assessments (an RCT conducted in Dausa, Rajasthan) indicate that children in treatment groups perform about 12 percentage points better than the control groups in school curricular subjects, although they are not taught and there is no age-grade curriculum mapped to textbooks created. There are three factors that likely affect the outcome: Pratham believes that it takes a village and technology to educate a child. Therefore, Pratham has identified three pillars for the implementation of the H Learning program \u2013 Social Structure, Digital Infrastructure and Teaching Learning Methodology. Pratham works with the village/urban community to create an environment of learning for children. This is done by interacting with different stakeholders of the community, raising awareness on the education scenario in their community and creating ownership amongst them for the learning interventions. The technology aspect of the project involves providing the community access to different digital devices to enhance creation of open learning spaces. This is implemented to motivate the volunteers to facilitate the children\u2019s groups while ensuring the continuation of their own education and learning. Pratham strives to make content engaging and interesting for learners. It works across three domains of learning \u2013 preparation for school, work and life. With the focus on creating contextualized content, the program curatesvideos and games into interesting packages \u2013 \u201ccourses\u201d. Making learning a choice- driven process. Task based games are being introduced to enable computational thinking among learners. Building on the know-how, success and reach of our education programs, the digital content endeavours to be an additional input in the overall development of children. Additionally, Pratham collaborates with numerous NGO Partners and platforms, to curate, develop and co-create learning resources for the non-traditional curriculum. Pratham started its digital intervention with the Hybrid learning program in the year 2015. Today, the H-learning program is a community driven, digitally aided intervention running in approximately 1000 communities of Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh reaching out to over 60,000 students with 6,000 tablets. In 2019, the program has been initiated in urban communities of Pune, Bangalore, Delhi and Mumbai. Subsequently, the digital resources and tablets were made available in Pratham\u2019s foundational programs, Vocational Programs and in the Early Childhood Education programs on an experimental basis. Today, digital hardware and software is available across 21 states reaching 300,000 learners through 18,000 tablets across India. These resources created for different age groups are available on the Pratham Open School YouTube Channel and as learning applications on the Google Playstore.The support of donors and partners has not only led to the expansion of Pratham\u2019s digital programs but also enabled the formation of core content groups within Pratham, producing over 2500 videos and 300 learning games across 11 regional languages. The 1000 communities of the Hybrid Learning Program continue to be \u2018demonstration sites\u2019 where new ideas are implemented, and new resources are experimented with. The program has evolved to enable the learner to make choices from an array of \u2018courses\u2019 available across domains and areas of interests. It has also empowered the community by engaging stakeholders and creating a cadre of village level facilitators or \u2018coaches\u2019 to support the learning ecosystem in the community. Pratham in its digital intervention measures the involvement and motivation of students through their interaction with the device and their engagement with the content resources.

Today, Pratham\u2019s Skilling programs are spread across the country to enable youth to access entry-level jobs in 10 major vocations. Pratham\u2019s affiliations include the National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) and multiple Sector Skill Councils. In 2020, Pratham re-designed its training models to incorporate digital resources and launched the Hybrid Skilling program, with the primary focus of helping youth find employment in the post-pandemic world. India has one of the youngest and largest workforce in the world, with 250 million youth expected to enter the working population over the next 10 years. However, less than 5% of India\u2019s workforce is formally skilled and over 80% of the labour force is engaged in the informal economy. There is a significant gap between the aspirations and abilities of youth. Training youth in vocational courses and entrepreneurship which are aligned with industry demands will help to ensure that the enormous gap between youth aspirations and abilities begins to close.\u00a0 Pratham runs more than 140 centres across 18 states and 1 Union Territory in India with a placement rate of over 85 percent. Over the past 10 years, Pratham\u2019s Vocational Training programs have helped more than 200,000 youth across the country access industry-specific training and placement opportunities, through a network of over 2,000 employers.

PCVC started as an outreach program with extensive intervention work in the urban communities of Mumbai consisting of poor migrant families. We identified thousands of working children between 6 and 18 years of age, engaged in industries like bag-making, shoe-making, cap-making, zari, gold polishing etc. Most of these children were migrants primarily belonging to Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan. The outreach\u2019s major intervention was to rescue children in coordination with the police and the Labour Department and persuading employers not to employ children for work. Extensive work was then carried out in both source states and destination states of child labourers to mitigate child labour and help repatriated children receive available compensation and rehabilitation facilities. Over the years, PCVC strengthened its interventions, reaching not only to child labourers but also children on move (unsafe migration of children, runaway children, street children), children with disability, children affected by natural or man-made calamities, children in institutions, children suffering from substance abuse, children in conflict with law, child survivors of sexual abuse and children belonging to the mostmarginalised communities. Through its work, PCVC strives to reduce the vulnerabilities so as to create a safety net for children by strengthening the child protection mechanisms through partnerships with government and non-government organisations. PCVC's activities extend to seven states in the country \u2013 Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Telangana and Uttar Pradesh. In 2022-23, PCVC covered 54 blocks, 18 districts (rural areas) and 730 communities in 9 cities (urban areas). Overall, PCVC reaches around 300,000 children annually through its direct and indirect interventions. PCVC strategy includes direct work with children and families in vulnerable communities. Indirect work as a resource organisation involves training of different stakeholders working in the field of child protection and partnership with necessary government departments to address these concerns. PCVC addresses the issues of child rights through multipronged interventions. PCVC\u2019s overall focus is on prevention, remediation, rehabilitation, policy advocacy and documentation for evidence-based practice. One of the key programs of PCVC is to rescue child labourers from exploitative situations. The aim is to repatriate these children back to their homes and seek rehabilitative measures to sustain them in their local and home settings. To facilitate this, PCVC has established various inter-state connections with the respective government departments, at both source and receiving ends. PCVC also works at important source and receiving points at railway stations in order to mitigate unsafe migration and trafficking of children as a major prevention operation. On the rehabilitation front, PCVC provides educational sponsorship for the rescued child labourers. This is for the children who attend school on a regular basis (up to 70% attendance) and their progress is monitored by PCVC staff in consultation with the schools. Another rehabilitation initiative is the Family Assistance Project which provides livelihood to the families of these vulnerable children to ensure the sustenance of children in education net and protects them from getting into any harmful practices like child labour. In the past, PCVC has run residential shelters for rescued child labourers in their home state as a demonstration of best practices for the state. A crucial prevention program is the Child Rights Help Desk which is set up at various locations to address the concerns of child rights and for local community members to seek redressal for the same. Child rights sessions are also conducted in schools as well as in the community to spread awareness on the child protection concerns. PCVC also engages in national advocacy-level interventions.

The centre promotes a culture of evidence-based decision making and seeks to develop and use simple yet rigorous methods to generate evidence on scale on the outcomes of social sector programs, especially education. It also aims to strengthen the link between evidence and action by building the capacity of individuals and institutions to design, conduct, understand and communicate the results of assessments that focus on key outcome indicators. \nThe word \u201caser\u201d (pronounced uh-sir) means \u201cimpact\u201d in Hindi and in many Indian languages. If development programs are to lead to desired outcomes, their impact on the ground should be regularly assessed. Large sums of public money are channelled into social sector programs. Information on how these investments translate into outcomes on the ground is a major indicator to evaluate their effectiveness. Currently, independent, timely data on outcomes are not available, especially at the district level. In addition, outside of urban India, there is an enormous shortage of people able to design, implement, and understand the nuts and bolts of assessment. ASER Centre was established to fill these critical gaps. \nASER Centre\u2019s flagship activity is the Annual Status of Education Report (commonly known as the ASER report), a household-based survey that collects information on children\u2019s schooling status and basic learning outcomes in almost every rural district in the country. \nThe basic nationwide ASER survey is an enormous participatory exercise that has involved about 500 organisations and upwards of 25,000 volunteers every year since 2005. Estimates of children\u2019s schooling and learning status are generated at district, state and national levels. In 2016, ASER switched to an alternate-year model where the \u2018basic\u2019 ASER is conducted in all rural districts of the country every other year rather than annually. In the gap years, a smaller survey (typically 1-2 districts per state) focuses on other age groups and domains. \nASER is an annual source of data on children\u2019s learning outcomes for India, and is often credited with changing the focus of discussions on education from inputs to outcomes. The ASER model has been adapted for use by organisations in 14 other countries across three continents. These organisations came together organically to form the People\u2019s Action for Learning (PAL) Network, with a secretariat housed in Nairobi. In addition, ASER Centre implements large- and small-scale research studies addressing a variety of domains. Conducted in collaboration with institutions such as UNICEF, the World Bank, the MacArthur Foundation, the University of Cambridge, Ambedkar University Delhi, and others, these studies seek to generate evidence that is actionable by both policy makers and practitioners. \nASER Centre also conducts a range of capacity building workshops on topics related to collecting and using evidence for action, both within the Pratham network as well as for partner organizations. Key features of all capacity-building modules include the integration of classroom and field activities; the constant movement between theory (or policy) and practice (or ground reality); and the use of a variety of classroom techniques (individual, small group and large group activities). \nThe basic ASER survey reaches almost every rural district in the country and covers more than 15,000 villages and 650,000 children (the sample size is more than twice that of the survey rounds conducted by the government\u2019s National Sample Survey Organization). Other research, assessment and capacity-building projects vary in reach and scale. \nIn the intervening years, ASER focuses on different aspects of children\u2019s education and learning. For instance, in 2017 and 2023, the survey focused on the enrollment patterns, learning levels, awareness and aspirations of rural youth aged 14-18 years. In 2019 and 2022, it focused on enrollment and school readiness of young children aged 4-8 years. \nWrite to us at contact@asercentre.org or visit asercentre.org \n\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Us\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Pratham  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBoard  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLeadership  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPartners  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tPrograms\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEducation  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVocational Training   \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnnual Status of Education Report  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPratham Council For Vulnerable Children  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCovid Response  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLearning Readiness & Catch Up  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLessons from the Pandemic  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tGet Involved\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJob Opportunities  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInternships  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tDelhi Office\t\t\t\t\t\t \nB- 4/59, Safdarjung Enclave\n1st Floor, New Delhi - 110 029\nEmail: info@pratham.org\nContact number: 01141651638\n\n\t\t Mumbai Office \nY.B.

My name is Arjun and I have been a part of the Program Management Group at Pratham. Our team is at a rather interesting niche in the organization \u2013 we interact with donors and manage those relationships, while also working with and supporting field teams on program planning and implementation. My three years at Pratham have been a rollercoaster. From spending hours on train stations to eating guinea pigs in Peru to conducting elections in a village in Uttar Pradesh, Pratham has exposed me to a range of experiences that I could never have imagined. As I look back at my time in the organization, while there have been (plenty of!) moments of frustration, I would not have had it any other way. I landed in Patna on a warm October night and caught a train to a district called Jamui on the edge of the state. The purpose of my trip was to visit a cluster of villages where local leaders had taken the initiative to work on children\u2019s learning. I met the cluster head with Gunjan (the Pratham staff member leading the initiative), and asked him what he would do if Pratham teams moved on from that area. He responded that they would manage on their own and that he would be that area\u2019s Gunjan. This completely blew me away. Later, I sat under the stars talking to villagers about their aspirations for children\u2019s learning. Their sheer enthusiasm and passion is forever ingrained in my memory. Not long after this field trip, I found myself on a plane to Peru. Our team was helping the Peruvian government pilot Pratham\u2019s teaching-learning approach in some rural schools. After a fair amount of travel, I reached a school in rural Cajamarca. It was morning, and the day\u2019s activities were about to begin. I saw two boys come out of the classroom, collect some stones, and start playing the \u2018number wheel\u2019 game. This activity is designed to help them understand the concept of place value and had been taught in class the previous day. This was really amazing! After my time in Peru, I returned to India and soon went back in Patna visiting new locations. The excitement of seeing people from India to Peru use, adapt and implement our approach fueled me and kept me awake, despite the jetlag. When I look back at my time with Pratham, it has been the opportunity to work together with an extremely diverse group of individuals that has been one of the biggest highlights. From field staff in a corner of Bihar to leadership teams sitting in Delhi and Mumbai, the organization has allowed me to interact with\u2013and more importantly learn from\u2013a most incredible and passionate set of individuals. By working on programs and developing collaborations with governments (in India or elsewhere), Pratham has given me the chance to really drive change and make my voice count. More than anything though, it has shown me the power of clear and focused action and convinced me that ambitious leaps in outcomes are possible in a future not too far from us. And that\u2019s really exciting. - Arjun WHAT MAKES PRATHAM CLICK I gaze at a book called In Search of Excellence on my table, written by two ex-McKinsey consultants on what makes great \u2018corporations\u2019 click and I\u2019m left in awe as to how Pratham, an NGO, has so intuitively, over and over again for the better part of the last two decades, managed to create an environment where everything just clicks.  Around this time last year, I knew little about the development sector. I\u2019d worked for two years in a consulting firm and was ready to apply my obligation to dissent to a bigger context. Tired of castigating our politicians during after-work parties, I decided it was vital for me to get a sense of how things worked on the ground. At the same time, I wanted to stick to my core skill of data analysis. Measurement, Monitoring and Evaluation seemed like a natural fit, and Pratham\u2019s work in the area immediately caught my attention.  Humble Beginnings When I joined in October 2017, I was fortunate enough to be trusted with Pratham\u2019s flagship program, called Read India. I was told I\u2019d be collaborating with more than 40 people from 10 states across India, which at the time seemed quite overwhelming! As I spent time with state-level MME teams, I realized how much effort Pratham had put in to cultivate a strong cadre of leaders in every state, an achievement few NGOs can boast of today. Data is often conveniently left out of the conversation in the social sector, yet here I was in an environment where people close to the field were discussing how our intervention could be more effective if some additional indicators were added to our monitoring formats1. I was humbled and elated to witness how strongly people in Pratham--whether our leadership in Delhi or a staff member in a remote village in Rajasthan--believed in the power of data to make better decisions.  Getting Into the Groove  In April 2018, Pratham decided to \u00a0shift its focus from learning in schools to learning in communities. The goal, broadly defined, was to better understand learning levels of all children in a village and work towards improving those, involving community members in the process. That is no small task when working in 14 different states (~3500 villages) with such diversity in contexts. However, we realized we could either be discouraged by the massive scale and complexity of this problem or break it down into simpler pieces. The first step? Making sure community members understood the problem of poor learning levels in the first place. The solution we came up with was a village report card, an assessment of their own community\u2019s learning levels led by village volunteers. From designing the report card to piloting and translating it to training team members at the state level who then conducted volunteer trainings, I was given complete freedom to call the shots. In a span of 30 days, volunteers collected data from 100,000 children across ~480 villages in 14 states2. Further, close to 70% of this data was collected on a tablet-based application we built within a week\u2019s time! Somehow, yet again, things just clicked! From our CEO to everyone on ground, it was heartening to get such tremendous support from all ranks of the organisation, all aligned toward a unified goal. I was doing some great work a year back too, but could I compare any of it to this exercise? I doubt it. Every Child Learning Well As I pause the music on my phone, my colleague from our Assessment Unit excitedly shares that one of our co-founders, Dr. Madhav Chavan, plans to make learning modules on music for rural children to access via Android tablets in their villages. \u2018Why limit our work to Math and Science?\u2019, he says. Another new day, another new idea, another new experiment; \u00a0practicing our obligation to dissent against traditional beliefs about education. \u00a0This pretty much sums up the one year I\u2019ve spent at Pratham. People around me might be from a variety of backgrounds, but it is our unshakeable faith in every child learning well that, I guess, makes Pratham click!  \u00a0 - Eshan THE MAGIC OF PRATHAM My journey with Pratham started in May of 2012, and although it has been some time now, Pratham still makes every day feel anew. Pratham was my first job out of university, so I was eager to absorb as well as apply my psychology degree in the real world. Over time, Pratham has gifted me with the opportunity to work in various capacities. I started in the People Development Unit, where I contributed to the creation of capacity building programs for people within Pratham. Most importantly, this first position taught be that training can be a \u2018tool for change\u2019. As I gained experience, I began creating content and training people in conducting Life Skills sessions for adolescents, youth and adults. This profile gave me a chance to develop content for children on various soft skills and also work with many, many teachers across the organization. With the learnings from the aforementioned experiences, I was provided a platform to lead a girls\u2019 education program working with Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalays (KGBVs). KGBVs are residential schools established for girls for girls in Upper primary grades in economically and socially backward blocks of the country. Pratham\u2019s partnership with KGBVs is in three states: Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Jharkhand. Working in these three geographies gives me immense satisfaction and a constant thirst to learn and then concretize my learning. Be it seeing the KGBV girls speak confidently about a Science experiment they learnt, hearing the stories of friendship and collaboration with teachers and wardens or watching the way my own team of 50 women is evolving in the process -- everything has been extremely fulfilling. One of the best things that Pratham helped me understand is how to nurture people. Looking at how my seniors have been with me and how they provided me with a safe space to grow, I learned about the impact that strong, consistent mentorship can have. Pratham works in the field of education, and even internally I\u2019ve been amazed at how much personal and professional growth is possible here. The people in this organization are exceptional at facilitating change, both externally and within. I believe these experiences of warmth and guidance have been instrumental in translating the same in my own work. In my journey of about six years now, Pratham blessed me with three values: trust, passion and resilience. I see these in people at all levels of Pratham, from the central team where I work to the state teams and instructors across the country. \u00a0Pratham trusts its people, the energy within the organization is contagious and whenever we have a set-back, we bounce back with energy! All in all, the Pratham experience is a magical one: there is magic in the work we do, the way we do it, the places Pratham takes us and the contentment at the end of the day! - Sukhada \n\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Us\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Pratham  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBoard  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLeadership  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPartners  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tPrograms\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEducation  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVocational Training   \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnnual Status of Education Report  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPratham Council For Vulnerable Children  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCovid Response  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLearning Readiness & Catch Up  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLessons from the Pandemic  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tGet Involved\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJob Opportunities  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInternships  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tDelhi Office\t\t\t\t\t\t \nB- 4/59, Safdarjung Enclave\n1st Floor, New Delhi - 110 029\nEmail: info@pratham.org\nContact number: 01141651638\n\n\t\t Mumbai Office \nY.B.

Intern \u2013 Girls and Women Program Intern for Maths- Early Years Content Intern, Content Development and Design \u2013 English Program PILOT, Pratham\u2019s Inspiring Leaders of Tomorrow During my six months interning with the Program Management Group, I had the opportunity to work with just a few of the smart, passionate and inspiring people who make Pratham the organization it is. While I got to explore many aspects of what PMG does, I mainly worked on research and evaluation components of Pratham\u2019s Early Years interventions. Through this work, I participated in many interesting discussions with donors, research collaborators and teams across the organization, cultivating useful skills throughout. My time in the central office was supplemented by field visits to rural and urban programs in six states, where I could see the successes and challenges of implementation at scale. The learnings from my internship are sure to influence my future, both personally and professionally, and I\u2019m so grateful to the everyone who enhanced my Pratham experience. - Charlotte As a research intern working primarily on government partnerships, I loved the independence I was given to tailor my internship experience and the responsibility to initiate projects that would have a visible impact on Pratham\u2019s collaboration with the government. I was also privileged to learn from an organisational culture which rewards strong work ethic and takes great pride in its values, which helped me assume greater individual accountability. Overall, my experience has been extremely rewarding in not only cementing my interest in development, but also helping me build a broad professional skill-set for the sector! - Romasha My summer internship at Pratham proved to be an unmatched learning experience. I was encouraged to get hands-on experience and was presented with multiple opportunities to do field work, reporting, research and even partner meetings - all in the span of just one month.\u00a0 At Pratham I was also encouraged to take initiative and ownership of tasks which helped me grow on a personal and a professional level.

A Summer Catch-Up Camp for Children Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) 2022 data shows that only 42.8% of Grade V children can read text at Grade II level. This figure was 50.4% in 2018. School enrollment of children in the 6-14 age group has progressively increased over the years. It reached 96% in 2010 and remained that way till the pandemic. While the problem of \u201cevery child in school\u201d has been largely solved, the goal of \u201cevery child learning well\u201d is still far from being achieved. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, ASER data showed that children's ability to read or do basic arithmetic needed substantial strengthening in India. Moreover, the pandemic exacerbated this issue, as prolonged school closures and economic disruptions in families led to major learning gaps among children (ASER 2022 data). The summer of 2023 presented an invaluable opportunity to address the issue of learning gaps and help children before the next school year began. CAMaL ka Camp 2023 (CAMaL: Combined Activities for Maximized Learning) focussed on students in Grade V transitioning to Grade VI in the academic year 2023-24, as well as students in Grades IV and VI. During the six-week camp, children were engaged in various learning activities to enable them to participate and communicate effectively. What did we do? In the summer of 2023 (May-June), Pratham facilitated catch-up camps for children transitioning from primary to the middle school through youth volunteers and government support. The goal was that all children who participated in the six-week camp would be able to read fluently with understanding and that they should be able to express their thoughts orally and in writing by the end of the camp. Implemented across the states of Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, and Uttar Pradesh, the summer camps witnessed overwhelming response, thanks to the concerted efforts of over 300,000 dedicated volunteers, predominantly youth aged 16 to 20, studying in Grade XI-XII. Learning was made engaging through various activities. A warm-up involved simple learning games. Storytelling and discussions followed, leading to writing activities. Focus later shifted to letters and words with games like Bara-khadi. Each child created a comprehensive dictionary with words, meanings, sentences, and pictures. Math word problems concluded the class. Campaign Ran For 6 Weeks Week 1 Warm-up activities with children and a baseline assessment to evaluate the current learning levels. Week 2 Followed by four weeks of instructional activities to teach and track children's progress. Week 3 Final week showcased the results of their progress Reached 3.48 million children (Grades IV-V-VI) Implemented Across Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh Government Collaboration The formal support from the Education Departments of the Governments of Madhya Pradesh and Bihar, as well as the continuous support received at the district and sub-district levels in Uttar Pradesh, played a pivotal role in ensuring the smooth execution of the summer camps. Training and Technology Every volunteer underwent short yet comprehensive training, equipped with a detailed manual outlining all the activities to be conducted, including resources such as para and story cards and QR codes to access short activity videos. Additionally, they were provided with Hindi language tools and data collection formats. To streamline the process, we employed a user-friendly weblink for volunteer registration, profile updates, and assessment data submission. Monitoring and Evaluation To maintain quality and accountability, our dedicated teams from Pratham and government personnel conducted regular on-site visits and telephonic calls to assess progress and verify assessment data submitted by volunteers. This meticulous oversight ensured the credibility and reliability of our outcomes. The results have been nothing short of extraordinary. Each of the three states witnessed at least a 24-percentage point improvement in children's ability to read a Grade II level text after only four weeks of instructional activities. The impact has been far-reaching, sparking the need to build from here and ensure a brighter future for these young children.

Fostering appropriate developmental abilities of children at this crucial stage has been closely associated with improved outcomes, such as better preparedness for school, enhanced retention and all round development of the child. There is clearly a need to look at the 3 to 8 year old age group in India very closely.The Annual Status of Education Report (ASER 2018) on \u2018Young Children\u2019 shows that across India, 28.8% of children at age 3 do not attend any government or private preschool. This report also shows a wide variation in enrollment patterns across states. While the National Education Policy 2020 has laid out that the appropriate age for a child to enter grade 1 is 6 years of age, a significant number of children in government schools are age 5 or below. The data also indicated that children who enter school before the appropriate age of 6 do comparatively worse than their older counterparts in the same grade.\u00a0 \u00a0 Some distinguishing elements of Pratham\u2019s approach towards Early Childhood Education are: This instructor or teacher is a local community member, who has a strong understanding of the local context, which helps her effectively interact with children and engage with parents. The content is based on the child\u2019s immediate surroundings. Activities are conducted with children in varying setups \u2013 big groups, small groups and individually \u2013 and are supported with contextualized print and play material such as flash cards, story books, story cards, picture cards, beads, clay and locally available objects of daily use. Children are regularly assessed by instructors through simple activities and observations. Indicators for assessment are such that they are easy to observe, measure and communicate. The findings of these periodic assessments help instructors track children\u2019s progress and are regularly communicated to parents as an engagement tool. Mothers are also engaged through periodic meetings, creation of mothers\u2019 groups in the community and individual home visits. Mother engagement includes discussions, games and material creation and distribution. Pratham\u2019s work in Early Childhood Education began over 25 years ago with community-based preschool centres in Mumbai, which were run by local young women. Over the years, the program has evolved to include multiple delivery models to suit the dynamic contexts and needs of different geographies across India. Today, Pratham\u2019s ECE program is implemented in the following ways: DIRECT APPROACH:\u00a0 Anganwadi Support: This involves mobilization of community volunteers to provide daily instructional activities to children in anganwadis, form and work with mothers\u2019 groups and conduct community events. Pratham provides training and on-site monitoring support to volunteers.\u00a0Pratham\u2019s anganwadi support model follows a \u2018teaching in, reaching out\u2019 approach where efforts are made to engage children both within the institution (i.e. anganwadis) as well as outside it \u2013 at home and in the community.\u00a0 Pratham partners with ICDS and provides support to anganwadi workers across the block.\u00a0Pratham provides content, material, and demonstrates appropriate teaching practices and supports anganwadi workers in carrying out learning activities with children.\u00a0 Outside the anganwadi, Pratham engages mothers in the community and encourages them to participate in their child\u2019s learning process. This is done by forming mothers\u2019 groups in every community and facilitating regular meetings where Pratham staff and community volunteers demonstrate learning activities for them to conduct with their children at home and discuss any issues related to their children\u2019s education.\u00a0 Pratham also conducts school readiness melas in every community before the start of each school year for children about to enter grade 1. This mela encourages a mother and child to come together to participate in the learning focused activities.\u00a0 See school readiness melas in action in Rajasthan and Assam. GOVERNMENT PARTNERSHIP APPROACH:\u00a0 In formal government partnerships, Pratham partners with the state/district-level government to strengthen existing government infrastructure and resources for the quality provision of Early Childhood Education, either in Anganwadi centres or in pre-primary classes and early grades within government schools. Pratham and the government jointly work towards the development of the program, including designing curriculum and material, training government personnel and supporting other key elements such as on-site monitoring and mentoring, measurement and assessment and periodic reviews. Pratham views these government partnerships as a key pathway to achieving systemic change.\u00a0 Pratham has an observation- and activity-based approach to measuring children\u2019s progress under the Early Childhood Education program. Assessment under the program is done in two ways: This information is communicated to parents via a Child Report Card with easy-to-understand grading indicators. Pratham uses this as an effective engagement tool for parents. Used to understand the impact of Pratham interventions on preschool children enrolled in Balwadis/Anganwadis as compared to children in the same areas who are not part of Pratham interventions. Data is collected and can be used for analysis to understand overall status of learning gains through Pratham programs. This instructor or teacher is a local community member, who has a strong understanding of the local context, which helps her effectively interact with children and engage with parents. The content is based on the child\u2019s immediate surroundings. Activities are conducted with children in varying setups \u2013 big groups, small groups and individually \u2013 and are supported with contextualized print and play material such as flash cards, story books, story cards, picture cards, beads, clay and locally available objects of daily use.

Mothers are also engaged through periodic meetings, creation of mothers\u2019 groups in the community and individual home visits. Mother engagement includes discussions, games and material creation and distribution. Pratham reaches about 492,000 children through its various ECE programs (around 92,000 through direct programs and an estimated 400,000 through government partnerships). Pratham also facilitated the creation of about 37,000 mothers\u2019 groups.\u00a0 Pratham\u2019s ECE program is currently active, through either the demonstrations or anganwadi support, in Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, West Bengal, Delhi, Gujarat, Bihar and Odisha. Pratham is in state government partnerships for Early Childhood Education in Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Haryana. ece@pratham.org Child Report Card \u2013Click here to read Early Years Research and Evaluation Summary Note \u2013\u00a0Click here to read [custom-twitter-feeds height=200px] \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPartner with us  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDonate  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJob Opportunities  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInternships  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Us\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Pratham  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBoard  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLeadership  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPartners  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tPrograms\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEducation  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVocational Training   \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnnual Status of Education Report  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPratham Council For Vulnerable Children  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCovid Response  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLearning Readiness & Catch Up  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLessons from the Pandemic  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tGet Involved\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJob Opportunities  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInternships  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tDelhi Office\t\t\t\t\t\t \nB- 4/59, Safdarjung Enclave\n1st Floor, New Delhi - 110 029\nEmail: info@pratham.org\nContact number: 01141651638\n\n\t\t Mumbai Office \nY.B.

The objective was to train youth (18\u201025 years) from economically disadvantaged backgrounds and provide them with employable skills, coupled with access to employment and entrepreneurship opportunities. Today, Pratham\u2019s Skilling programs are spread across the country to enable youth to access entry-level jobs in 10 major vocations. Pratham\u2019s affiliations include the National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) and multiple Sector Skill Councils. In 2020, Pratham re-designed its training models to incorporate digital resources and launched the Hybrid Skilling program, with the primary focus of helping youth find employment in the post-pandemic world. India has one of the youngest and largest workforce in the world, with 250 million youth expected to enter the working population over the next 10 years. However, less than 5% of India\u2019s workforce is formally skilled and over 80% of the labour force is engaged in the informal economy. There is a significant gap between the aspirations and abilities of youth. Training youth in vocational courses and entrepreneurship which are aligned with industry demands will help to ensure that the enormous gap between youth aspirations and abilities begins to close.\u00a0 Pratham runs more than 140 centres across 18 states and 1 Union Territory in India with a placement rate of over 85 percent. Over the past 10 years, Pratham\u2019s Vocational Training programs have helped more than 200,000 youth across the country access industry-specific training and placement opportunities, through a network of over 2,000 employers. In 2022-23, more than 30,000 youth were trained.

LEVEL 3 Practical skills training to be completed either at a Pratham training centre, industry partner, or a community-based centre. Duration of 30-45 days. In addition to industry-specific skills, students are also offered basic English, computer literacy and life skills. Pratham currently offers certifications related to the following domains: Apart from youth, Pratham also trains informal economy workers through two pathways: A unique aspect of Pratham\u2019s vocational training model is the focus on post-placement tracking and support. Youth are tracked and mentored for one year after graduation to encourage them to sustain in the workforce.

Today, as we confront an unprecedented challenge, we are leveraging our experience and agility to navigate the pandemic and fulfill our mission.  How COVID-19 changed the Pratham approach of \u201cteaching\u201d children to \u201creaching\u201d families to ensure the continuing education of children during the pandemic-induced school closures. What the pandemic taught us about having an agile and flexible approach in our methodologies which would empower us to deal with lockdown restrictions and COVID outbreaks.\u00a0 A community-based campaign carried out by Pratham in response to the school closure caused by COVID-19. The aim of the campaign was to encourage parents, family members and others in the community to engage with children via fun activities and help them learn. The number of children, youth and adults not attending schools or educational institutions because of COVID-19 has spiked globally. In India alone, an estimated 300 million learners across all age groups are out of school right now.  In the last twenty five years, Pratham has worked on scale with children across the country on a range of educational interventions and in a variety of learning contexts. In these difficult times, Pratham is working to provide children across the country access to engaging learning content.  The lockdown in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic has led to school closure across the country. While children are not physically attending school, many state government education departments have been proactive in developing technology solutions to engage children and teachers through online platforms.  With teams spread across the country, we have taken up initiatives and activities to support relief and safety measures in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Through our Mumbai Food Project initiative, we are providing support those most in need.                 \n\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Us\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Pratham  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBoard  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLeadership  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPartners  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tPrograms\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEducation  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVocational Training   \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnnual Status of Education Report  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPratham Council For Vulnerable Children  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCovid Response  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLearning Readiness & Catch Up  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLessons from the Pandemic  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tGet Involved\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJob Opportunities  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInternships  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tDelhi Office\t\t\t\t\t\t \nB- 4/59, Safdarjung Enclave\n1st Floor, New Delhi - 110 029\nEmail: info@pratham.org\nContact number: 01141651638\n\n\t\t Mumbai Office \nY.B.

The Sarde family practices agriculture and hail from Hiwara Korde village, in Maharashtra's Akola district. Both Jyoti and her husband spend their day working on the field, but there is hardly any activity after the national lockdown. However, it has allowed Jyoti to spend some time with Krushnali, and the 'Shale Baherchi Shala' (School, outside a school) correctly serves the purpose! Swati, our CRL clicked this photo, and she then sent it to the state Whatsapp group. \nTaruna (Grade 1), Tijesh and Abhay (Grade 3) created their own telephone after watching a Whatsapp video titled 'Tring Tring Telephone'.The video was shared with them as part of Pratham's Karona, Thodi Masti, Thodi Padhai initiative. The trio lives in the Bunagaon village of Kondagaon district in Chhattisgarh. The village is in a dense forest and comes under the larger region of Bastar inhabited by several tribal populations. Despite being in remote areas with limited connectivity, children continue to learn. This picture captures the wonderful moment where these children not only created something themselves but also were amused by their own creation. And the cherry on top: Even the dense forest cant disturb the connectivity and voice quality of their own conference call! \nGokul (6th grade, on the left) and Sagar (1st grade) are from Sugaturu Village, Devanahalli Block, Bengaluru Rural District. Both of them stay in the same neighbourhood in the village. Devanahalli is a Hybrid Hamara Gaon village, and Gokul is an active participant in the H-learning activities. He stays with his grandmother, and his parents have migrated to work to Sidlaghatta, a nearby town. Sagar's parents are farmers. We have reached them through a volunteer named Murali, who is also from this village. Our CRL is in touch with Murali through WhatsApp. Gokul also follows our science videos on the PraDigi App and makes science models by watching them. However, this experiment is not in the App, and our CRL showed it during a science event in the village. Due to the lockdown, children are not able to meet regularly and play with each other. But these two meet daily for a couple of hours and keep themselves engaged through these activities. #PrathamMoments  \nAnjali Rao listens to a story narrated by her grandmother Shyam Bai Bhatt as both of them follow the 'story activity' sent by us through an SMS. Anjali is in the fifth grade, and her parents are daily wage labourers. The photo, clicked by our volunteer, is from M.K Bahara village in Chhattisgarh's Mahasamund district. This is a 'Hamara Gaon' village, and grandmothers here have been narrating stories to children as part of our program for the past two years.     According to the WHO, the two most important preventive measures against COVID-19 are handwashing and social distancing. Wanting to keep his community safe, Chaitanya set out to create an invention that would allow multiple users to wash their hands at the same while maintaining the required distance between them. The enterprising youth learned his trade at Pratham\u2019s plumbing program. Chaitanya\u2019s invention, which he has dedicated to his grandmother, now stands at the main entrance of his village in Alibaug, where members of his community use it happily\u2014and frequently.   Nabanita Das, a resident of Pachim Baligaon village in Assam's Nagaon district, proudly displays the 'Lion and the Mouse' story written by her in her own words! This story-making activity was sent through an SMS, as part of Pratham's 'Karona, Thodi Masti, Thodi Padhai' initiative. A witness to this activity, Nabanita's mother clicked this photo and sent it to us.  Look at little learners across the country making the most of being at home. We sent them an engaging activity through an SMS in 10 languages. The activity is part of an ongoing series of messages under our initiative - Karona, Thodi Masti, Thodi Padhai - through which we share fun-filled learning activities with children in 20 states. Here, you can see them learn addition and strategy while having loads of fun!  This goes to all the spirited frontline Corona Warriors like Jyoti, an alumnus of the Pratham Healthcare program. In her capacity as a General Duty Assistant has taken care of several COVID-19 affected patients. When asked what keeps her going in such a fearful scenario, she says, \u201cOne can always choose to run away, but what if our near and dear ones suffer from this? Will we run away even then?\u201d On her part, Jyoti very humbly requests everyone to stay at home which will help her and other Frontline warriors, who have left their families at home, to fight and win a definitive battle against the Corona pandemic.  How many words can you make from the letter you pick? We asked children this question through an SMS in 10 languages across 20 states. Here is a glimpse of how they responded to this fun activity which was shared as part of 'Karona - Thodi Masti, Thodi Padhai', our Remote Learning initiative."}, {"url": "https://www.pratham.org/covid-19-response/prathams-community-based-campaign-for-learning-readiness-catch-up/", "title": "Learning Readiness & Catch Up \u2013 Pratham", "content": "August-September-October 2021  Due to the pandemic, pre-schools and schools across the country have now been closed for more than a year. Teachers have attempted to send children learning materials using whatever means were available. At their end, families have tried to support the education of their children in the best way they could. Yet, there is widespread agreement that these efforts have been largely ineffective and significantly uneven. Across the globe, there is serious concern about whether all children will come back to school when once schools reopen. Schools, families, and policymakers are worried about the impact of the pandemic on children\u2019s socio-emotional development and the extent of learning loss that may have occurred.  As far as schooling is concerned, the COVID crisis has brought unprecedented challenges: for example, children who are enrolled in Grade II today have never been to school and possibly have not had much exposure to pre-school education either. Children in today\u2019s Grade V were finishing Grade III when the pandemic struck. Data from India indicates that even in 2018, more than half of all children in Grade IV could not read a Grade II level text or perform simple 2-digit subtraction. It is very likely at the situation will have worsened in the past year and a half.\n By June-July in a regular year, summer vacations are over, and schools have re-opened after the holidays. Children look forward to this time. Keeping in mind this usual school calendar timeline, and aligned with the expectations of children, parents, and teachers, we at Pratham feel it is time for learning to begin again \u2013 and importantly, in a fun and engaging way!  To this end, whether schools open or not, during August & September Pratham will carry out a community-based learning campaign in over 10,000 rural and urban communities across the country. The campaign rolled out across the country in the beginning of August 2021, and is encouraging parents and family members as well as others in the community to join children, engage with them in interesting and fun activities, and help them learn.  The campaign has two focus areas: (1)\u00a0 Early years learning readiness for children currently in Grade I and II; via mothers individually and in groups (2) \u201cCatch up\u201d campaign for children currently in Grade III to VI via local volunteers who conduct instructional activities and games with small groups in the neighborhood. Volunteers or youth are conducting Mohalla Math Learning Camp this month and will be conducting the Mohalla Language Learning Camp in September to help children build/re-build foundational reading and math skills. The campaign will be carried out in over 10,000 communities in August and September. Given the uncertainty around movement due to the pandemic, the team is working through multiple scenarios as described below. Based on the experiences of the past year, there are three likely scenarios outlined below: It is likely that any of these scenarios may prevail at any time, and hence the education sector needs to be prepared. After a year of school closure, we should be in a position to answer questions like What kind of activities are possible in each scenario? And with what kind of outcomes? Here are the possible scenarios: Pratham\u2019s current community learning campaign will contribute to finding some of these answers in the next few months, especially in terms of what can be achieved in communities by local people. \u00a0In addition to the primary goal of addressing children\u2019s learning needs, Pratham is also initiating special exercises for community volunteers so that capability for digital interactions is enhanced in these communities for future work. As part of Pratham\u2019s Education for Education program (EfE), volunteers who give time for helping children learn are being offered a basic course in digital literacy. The course is available to interested volunteers and mothers. After registering on Pratham Digital\u2019s YouthNet portal, a participant completes the course via online content and assignments. The course will cover basic digital knowledge like: Internet behaviour, WhatsApp, email, zoom and uploading data. Whether schools open or not, keeping safety of all in mind, we hope that Pratham\u2019s community campaign for learning will help young children \u201cleap forward\u201d and older children \u201ccatch up\u201d.\u00a0 These community-based activities can act as a \u201cwarm up\u201d before school opens. A rise in overall digital capability will enable families and communities to support their children and to accompany them on their journey of growth and development, in school and in life.  \u00a0 Pratham is happy to share the community campaign content with any interested individual or organization.

Download the full interview transcript: https://www.hbs.edu/creating-emerging-markets/Documents/transcripts/Chavan-Banerji_Final-Transcript%20for%20Web.pdf Interview Summary Chavan and Banerji begin the interview by reflecting on their educations and early careers prior to Pratham. Both moved to the United States for graduate studies, obtaining PhD degrees in Chemistry and Education respectively. When Chavan returned to India in 1986, he intended to become a chemistry teacher. However, he was drawn to an adult literacy program started by the Indian Prime Minister at the time, Rajiv Gandhi. The adult literacy program later began to dissipate after 1991 following India's shift towards liberalization. In 1992-93, the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) began focusing on primary education with the goal of bringing business, government and the voluntary sectors together in order to understand and solve problems with the education system in India. It was in this context that Chavan co-founded Pratham in Mumbai, with the goal of implementing a new model and approach to the situation. Banerji joined Pratham in 1996, while it was starting to expand by opening hundreds and then thousands of preschool centers around Mumbai. During her first years with Pratham, Banerji conducted a study to assess the math skills of 3rd and 4th grade students. The simple assessment evolved into ASER, the Annual Status of Education Report \u2013 an academic report that is widely used in India as well as other countries. She emphasizes the need to develop easily replicable educational tools and assessments that can stimulate policy action and change. As India continued to develop rapidly in the 2000s, Chavan explains that the need to address gaps in the education system became increasingly clear, particularly to businesses which started establishing foundations dedicated to supporting education. As an organization, Pratham held a unique position as it worked alongside both government and businesses. They built partnerships with government at different levels, and Chavan emphasizes how that was important given that there is \u201cno single thing called government.\u201d He relates that working with different layers of government was comparable to \u201cplaying the whole court.\u201d Banerji and Chavan proceed by laying out the challenges that persist in India\u2019s education sector, especially following the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and the expansion of remote learning technologies. They discuss a need to look at education as a whole from a different perspective, utilizing technology to break down barriers to learning. This includes promoting the use of PraDigi, a digital initiative that provides tablets equipped with a learning app delivering high-quality, interactive educational content. Chavan underscores the importance of utilizing such technology to foster an easily accessible and open learning environment. To conclude the interview, Banerji and Chavan address the question of leadership succession, as Banerji became Pratham\u2019s Chief Executive Officer in 2015 after Chavan. While Chavan remains involved, he articulates advice for leaders who should \u201cget out of the way of the next person,\u201d preparing the organization and relationships within it for a new leadership style. While describing themselves as different when it comes to their approach, both Banerji and Chavan express a persistent commitment to expanding the organization\u2019s mission further, by having \u201cevery child in school and learning well.\u201d This article was originally published by Harvard Business School.

You can read the full article here: \u2018The school of my dreams\u2019 It is a bright sunny Thursday morning \u2014 August 15, 2047. The school compound is packed with children and adults, current students, families and friends. There are also many others, those who have been part of this school community in past decades. On each side of the open courtyard is a big screen. People who are not here in person can link virtually to watch, participate and interact. Like always, right in the centre of the compound, on a tall pole, is the tricolour waiting to be hoisted and unfurled. From the outside, the school building does not look different from before. But inside, it is very different. No longer can you see desks and benches in rows facing the blackboard. Now there are rooms with open space where teachers and children can organise themselves in whatever way they want. Grades have given way to stages. Libraries now have devices and tool kits that can be borrowed to take home. Laboratories are open for even young children to experiment and tinker. A group of middle-aged women are on the stage. Twenty-five years ago, they had worked closely together. In the centre is the Standard I teacher from 2022 and her friend, the anganwadi instructor from that time. Around them are mothers, whose children were either in anganwadi or in the early grades more than two dozen years ago. From a distance, this group looks like a tight bunch of colourful flowers. The women speak of a time, when a fearsome pandemic had shut schools for two years. Those were bad years. When the schools opened, everyone agreed that it was essential for young children to have strong foundations for future learning. Standard I and II teachers joined hands with the nearby anganwadi instructors and began to build this pathway. Mothers joined the effort, families engaged in fun learning activities with children at home and small groups of mothers met every week in their neighbourhood to discuss what more they could do together to strengthen their children\u2019s learning, growth and development. Since then, the village has not looked back. The path from anganwadi to school has become smoother and stronger over time. For many years now, little children enrol in first grade, confident and ready. One of the mothers invited her daughter on to the stage. The tall young lady who ran up the steps was in Standard I in 2022. Today in her early thirties, she is a surgeon in a nearby hospital. With gratitude, she embraced the women standing around her, for placing her on the road to success. Next in line are children from the middle school stage. Their excitement is palpable even to those far away. The screens in the school yard are now showing a film made by these children. It is about water in the village. In middle school nowadays, groups of students work together, to identify a problem in the community, understand it and work towards a solution. Moving well beyond the confines of the textbook, using real life situations to learn, is now the norm. Over the years, rainfall had become erratic and uncertain. Middle school children had been tracking changes over time. They are currently working with adults to develop water storage solutions that could help everyone in the dry months. Older students had been patiently waiting their turn. Once on stage, they speak of their time in high school. One student laughs, as she recounts how difficult her father\u2019s life had been; his entire time in high school was dominated by exams and his life afterwards dependent solely on his exam result. Luckily, this does not happen anymore. The young girl explains \u2014 she can take any exam online anytime, whenever she feels ready. \u201cWe use ATM\u201d she says proudly, \u201cthe Anytime Testing Machine\u201d. She smiles some more. \u201cMy father is jealous that exams are not high stakes any more. Today, there are so many ways to move ahead.\u201d For example, she and a few friends had been experimenting with small business ideas. The school provided a bit of seed funding and a lot of encouragement and guidance. From the stage, she invited people of the village to look at their AI-generated movies based on stories of individual clients. It was now time to raise the flag. Fluttering in the breeze, the tricolour looked down proudly on the school below. Let us close our eyes and imagine. Every child must be able to explore her interests and to discover her own potential. Keeping all children in mind, schools, families and communities must ensure building strong foundations, developing choices for pathways and opportunities for learning. We need to work systematically and persistently, building on what has worked each year, learning from what did not, experimenting with what is needed but perhaps still just out of reach, navigating around obstacles and tracking progress. The school has to be the anchor of community life, leveraging the past, building the present and planning for a better future. If our heads, hearts and hands come together, it is possible that every school on August 15, 2047 will be celebrating like the one we are reading about now.

This means that ASER provides a comprehensive and up-to-date picture of the state of education in rural India. This information is essential for policymakers and educators who are working to improve the quality of education in India. Dr. Rukmini Banerji, CEO of Pratham Education Foundation, talks about how ASER has become more than just a data collection. It has become an experience that connects every Indian to their homeland. This is because ASER is a bottom-up 'social movement' that involves the participation of thousands of volunteers from all over India. ASER has helped to raise awareness about the importance of education and to create a sense of shared responsibility for improving the quality of education in India. In the podcast, Decoding Impact by Sattva Knowledge Institute, Dr. Banerji, ex-director of ASER Centre, discusses the success of ASER and how it all started.

Over the last decade or so, girls have dropped out of school disproportionately due to factors like early marriage, chores at home and cost of education [National Family Health Survey-5 (2019-21) data]. Pratham\u2019s experience indicates that once a learner has dropped out of school, it is near impossible for them to find their way back. While India has open schooling opportunities, there is lack of awareness, accessibility, adequate motivation and support for a student to use open schooling as a way to continue their education. Fewer people progressing for higher studies, low quality secondary education, an ever-increasing demand of a skilled labour force reinforces the need for an effective intervention in the secondary education space. A secondary school certificate is a prerequisite for entry into higher education, skill apprenticeship and for promotion in jobs. Pratham believes that by making education accessible and closer to home, it is possible to overcome logistical and social challenges and begin to bridge the gender gap in learning and education. Understanding the importance of secondary education, especially Grade 10, Pratham has deployed a focused intervention, the Second Chance program, to enable young girls and women to complete their secondary schooling and forge strong pathways for the future. Pratham's Second Chance program focuses on providing school dropouts, especially young girls and women, another chance at education. Second Chance aims to support those who could not complete their secondary education. The program focuses on completion of Grade 10. The academic certificate that they receive opens the door for further opportunities for lifelong learning and growth. The Second Chance program uses innovative teaching methods, to provide accessible learning opportunities very close to where the students live. Currently, the Second Chance program is operational in Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Rajasthan, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka.

The program runs in two phases. The first phase is called the Foundation Course (FC) which lasts for 3-4 months and focuses on basic foundational concepts of subjects like English, Mathematics, Language (state-specific), Science and Home Science. Assessment in the form of a pre-test at the onset of FC and post-test at the end of FC are conducted to track the learning levels of students and their growth during the course. During this phase, life skills-focused activities are also conducted with the learners, concentrating on enhancement of communication, decision-making and critical thinking skills. After the Foundation Course, students move to the Main Course which focuses on helping learners prepare for the Board-mandated curriculum. The progress during the Main Course is tracked through internal assessments. Interactive methods such as activity-based learning, group work and an emphasis on self-learning are the highlights of the course. The Main Course formally ends with the students appearing for the Board Examination. Additionally, the program delivers non-academic modules focused on providing learners exposure to available opportunities after Grade 10.

To work towards this goal, Pratham provides a broad-based platform for activities in education and skill development across India.  By 2005, after just ten years of existence, Pratham\u2019s presence had expanded to more than 10 states across India.

India\u2019s New Education Policy (NEP 2020) underscores this crucial importance of Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) and Foundational Literacy and Numeracy (FLN). In this evolving landscape, Pratham continues to invest heavily in expanding and exploring how to impact children\u2019s holistic development and foundational abilities during these early years. Pratham believes that building strong foundational abilities in children during their early years will make them effective learners and eliminate the need for remedial interventions in the later years. Pratham\u2019s work with Early Childhood Education began in 1995\u00a0 with\u00a0 balwadis in Mumbai, run by community-based\u00a0volunteers. Since then, our early years interventions, focusing on holistic development and learning of children of 0-8 years, have evolved considerably through years of experimentation with different content, material, and delivery models. These programs use play-based pedagogy, local resources, low-cost and appropriate material, and involve caregivers, especially mothers. In 2022-2023, Pratham reached over  56 lakh children through government partnerships and nearly 5.74 lakh children directly through education activities. Over 2.17 lakh mothers participated in Pratham-led mothers\u2019 groups and nearly 17 lakh mothers  were reached through Pratham\u2019s government partnerships. Pratham\u2019s Early Years programs are active in 18 states across India. Ensure awareness of early development milestones among caregivers and provision of early stimulation for children aged 0-3 years. Important to ensure enrollment of children in their early years in Anganwadi or pre-school. It is critical to push the age of entry into Grade 1 at 6 years and ensure that children spend enough years in pre-school in order to be ready for school. Ensure Foundational Literacy and Numeracy by Grade 3. IN ANGANWADI/SCHOOL: TEACHER-LED/VOLUNTEER-LED ACTIVITIES  In Pratham\u2019s community-based Early Years programs, volunteers in the community are mobilised and trained to conduct daily activities with children inside the Anganwadi, thereby supporting and equipping the Anganwadi functionaries with effective early childhood care and education practices. These activities, called \u201cAnganwadi Mei Dhoom\u201d, further foster community involvement in children\u2019s early childhood education. In government partnership programs, typically with the state Education or Women and Child Development Departments, Pratham trains government Key Resource Persons (KRPs) on play- and activity-based pedagogy for ECCE and FLN, as relevant. These KRPs, in turn, train the respective frontline functionaries (ie, Anganwadi workers or school Grade 1-2 teachers) and subsequently mentor them through visits and demonstrations. Practice is an integral feature of our approach to equip government personnel. The KRPs conduct practice classes before they train others; further, as part of their visits to Anaganwadis or schools, they conduct activities themselves to demonstrate these to the frontline functionaries. IN COMMUNITY: MOTHERS\u2019 GROUPS AND WORKSHOPS Pratham has formed thousands of mothers\u2019 groups at the community-level. Mothers are encouraged to meet every week in their groups to discuss how they can be actively involved in their children\u2019s learning and development process. Guided content pieces like  Idea Cards and Idea Videos, focusing on development milestones and stimulation and learning activities, are shared with mothers' groups. Mothers view and discuss these during their weekly meetings and do the suggested activities with their children at home. Further, on a monthly or quarterly basis, mothers are invited to the school for a mothers\u2019 workshop. This helps strengthen the connection between the teacher and the mothers. IN COMMUNITY: SCHOOL READINESS MELAS Within the early childhood spectrum, one of Pratham\u2019s major objectives is to ensure that children are \u201cReady for School\u201d. A key activity undertaken by Pratham in this regard is a community event \u2013 the \u201cSchool Readiness Mela\u201d (also referenced in NIPUN Bharat guidelines of the Government of India, p.239). This event seeks to engage local community members at large, including children, mothers, families, Anganwadi workers, school teachers, and government officials. The purpose of the Mela is to understand children\u2019s readiness for school through a variety of fun activities and engage mothers in their children\u2019s learning journey.\u00a0 Mothers are given a report card which explains the level of their children across domains and are oriented on simple activities to do at home to build their children\u2019s ability on the same skills. After a period of 1-2 months, a second round of Melas is done in which the children\u2019s progress is recorded. TEACHING-LEARNING MATERIALS Inside the Anganwadi/school, Pratham believes that classrooms should be \u201cprint-rich\" with a variety of story books, story cards, picture cards, and flash cards as well as \u201cplay-rich\" with a variety of manipulatives, toys, and other play-based activities. In community and home-based activities, Pratham advocates the use of locally available materials \u2013 things one can easily find at home. The objective is to make education accessible to all by eliminating the need for expensive or inaccessible materials.

The tools have been developed keeping in mind that children learn at different paces; the tools are, therefore, progressive in nature. Each skill in the assessment tool is split into four stages and children\u2019s progress is tracked over the course of an academic year in order to assess their growth. DIGITAL CONTENT FOR CAREGIVERS AND TEACHERS In 2015, Pratham started tablet- and mobile-based initiatives that experimented with community-based learning using digital learning games, WhatsApp and text messages and videos. Pratham has also created a repository of digital content in the form of videos, games, online instructional material for caregivers and teachers of 0 to 8-year-olds. Pratham\u2019s artificial intelligence and machine learning-based content creation and development of speech-to-text and text-to-speech began five years ago. Pratham now collaborates with leading commercial and academic groups to develop independent learning and assessment tools.  RESEARCH PROJECTS  Under the Early Years program, Pratham has undertaken a number of research projects to understand the scope, build evidence and plan interventions to scale impact.\u00a0 Learn more about these projects here. \n\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Us\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Pratham  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBoard  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLeadership  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPartners  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tPrograms\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEducation  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVocational Training   \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnnual Status of Education Report  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPratham Council For Vulnerable Children  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCovid Response  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLearning Readiness & Catch Up  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLessons from the Pandemic  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tGet Involved\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJob Opportunities  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInternships  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tDelhi Office\t\t\t\t\t\t \nB- 4/59, Safdarjung Enclave\n1st Floor, New Delhi - 110 029\nEmail: info@pratham.org\nContact number: 01141651638\n\n\t\t Mumbai Office \nY.B.

However, due to familial and societal pressures, she got married at the age of 21, soon after completing her Bachelor\u2019s degree. Her family arranged her marriage into a household where women were often confined to their homes. Pravesh's dreams of building a career were set aside, and despite her eagerness, she struggled to find support within her family. Pravesh's family, comprising six members, relied on her husband's contract work related to SIM card porting. Their 11-year-old son, Arnav, is in Grade 3, and her father-in-law was a former Sarpanch of the village. In 2021, when Pratham reached Pravesh's village, the primary focus was on educational activities, including learning camps in schools and community classes for children, facilitated by dedicated volunteers. Pratham\u2019s team started creating mothers' groups in the community to support early childhood education. Initially hesitant due to the restrictions at home, Pravesh eventually agreed to participate in a mothers' group after understanding the positive impact it could have on her child's learning. These groups met weekly at Pravesh's house, discussing various learning activities and sharing their experiences while engaging with their children at home. Pravesh, with her education and understanding of the activities, emerged as the natural leader of the group. Together, they had a profound impact on the children and the entire village by promoting education and fostering women's active involvement. One significant moment came when the group decided to meet at the village school. Pravesh yearned to attend but faced resistance at home. Unfortunately, she had to miss the meeting, leaving her feeling disheartened. In April 2023, a team from Nigeria visited the village to get a deeper understanding of Pratham's programs. The mothers of the group decided to meet the visitors as a united front, and Pravesh, as the group leader, was eager to join them but was skeptical if she would be allowed to step out of the house. The other mothers and Pratham team members passionately urged her family to grant permission for her to participate in the meeting with the visitors, extending a warm invitation to the family to join the occasion. Fortunately, the family allowed Pravesh to attend the meeting. During the visit, Pravesh spoke with the visitors in English and translated their questions and responses for the other mothers in Hindi. Her ability to bridge the language gap left the villagers, along with her family, deeply impressed and proud of her. This incident marked a turning point in Pravesh's life. Her family no longer restricted her from leaving the house, and this inspiring story prompted other families to reevaluate their constraints on women, allowing them to connect more freely. Pravesh's journey continues to evolve as she collaborates with Pratham, contributing significantly to children's learning and inspiring many. Her message to other women is clear: \u201cDon't give up on your dreams. Small efforts can lead to significant accomplishments and inspire others.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Us\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Pratham  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBoard  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLeadership  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPartners  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tPrograms\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEducation  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVocational Training   \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnnual Status of Education Report  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPratham Council For Vulnerable Children  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCovid Response  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLearning Readiness & Catch Up  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLessons from the Pandemic  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tGet Involved\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJob Opportunities  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInternships  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tDelhi Office\t\t\t\t\t\t \nB- 4/59, Safdarjung Enclave\n1st Floor, New Delhi - 110 029\nEmail: info@pratham.org\nContact number: 01141651638\n\n\t\t Mumbai Office \nY.B.

She has three sons, daughters-in-law, and three grandchildren. The family's livelihood is sustained through labour work and Dadi's old-age pension. Dadi's association with Pratham began in 2020 during a volunteer mobilization drive. Her enthusiasm for the initiative was truly inspiring. She quickly became a passionate advocate for ensuring there were no gaps in her grandchildren\u2019s education. Her granddaughter, Nidhi, inspired by her Dadi's dedication, embarked on a journey as a Pratham volunteer. Nidhi's commitment, in turn, led to her younger siblings, Kafi and Prince, actively participating in Pratham's Children's Club activities. Dadi's influence extended far beyond her immediate family. She has affectionately named the children\u2019s group, the Bhagat Singh group. She engages with the eight learners in the group with stories inspired by their daily lives, and their learning activities begin with her tales and end with her entertaining riddle-guessing games. Dadi's stories, featuring characters like \u201cRaja-Rani,\" \u201cJungle ka Raja,\" and \u201cAkbar-Birbal,\" have become an integral part of their educational journey. She is equally excited about Pratham's learning games like \u201cTali Chutki\" and \u201cTodo Jodo\". Dadi's bond with the children is unwavering. Whenever she is unwell, they express their concern by visiting her, strengthening the connection that fuels her determination to bring joy to their lives. Recently, Dadi's heartwarming gesture captured the entire village's attention. She used her pension to purchase a blackboard for the children, addressing a long-standing need. This board has become a valuable asset, enhancing the children's camp activities and bringing them immense joy. Dadi's aspirations don't stop here. She envisions establishing a shared library for all the children's club groups in the village, with support from the community. Her desire is rooted in a strong belief: \u201cI never attended school, and I couldn't provide higher education opportunities to my sons, but I am determined to ensure that my grandchildren and other children in the village receive adequate education to become independent.\" Dadi Rajpati is a shining example of the impact Pratham's initiatives can have, both at a personal and community level. Her unwavering commitment to education and her dedication in ensuring access to learning serve as a beacon of hope for the people in Madeena village. \n\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Us\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Pratham  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBoard  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLeadership  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPartners  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tPrograms\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEducation  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVocational Training   \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnnual Status of Education Report  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPratham Council For Vulnerable Children  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCovid Response  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLearning Readiness & Catch Up  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLessons from the Pandemic  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tGet Involved\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJob Opportunities  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInternships  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tDelhi Office\t\t\t\t\t\t \nB- 4/59, Safdarjung Enclave\n1st Floor, New Delhi - 110 029\nEmail: info@pratham.org\nContact number: 01141651638\n\n\t\t Mumbai Office \nY.B.

At the age of 11, she is a grade 6 student hailing from Seehmai Karirat village in Ambedkar Nagar, Uttar Pradesh. Aradhya was eagerly looking forward to spending her summer vacation at her maternal grandparents' place, but when she heard about CAMaL Ka Camp, she felt torn, thinking she wouldn't be able to join her friends since she had to leave in just 2-3 days. As the camp started, an enthusiastic volunteer \u2013 Shiva, began with a fun warm-up activity that all the children thoroughly enjoyed. Watching her friends engrossed in the activities, Aradhya couldn't help but feel curious. Her friends and the volunteer convinced her to participate, even if it was just for two days. Persuaded by their excitement, Aradhya agreed. In the first two days, Aradhya and her friends wholeheartedly participated in the learning activities and games that created an atmosphere of joy and excitement. Among the highlights, her favourite was the 'Kahani Train' stories, a daily audio story that ends with an interacting session. These stories captivated her imagination. As the second day came to a close, Aradhya found herself feeling upset about leaving the camp to visit her grandparents. She had grown so fond of the camp and its experiences that she didn't want to miss out on any more fun. In a touching display of camaraderie, Aradhya's friends decided to intervene and approached her parents. They made a request and pleaded to allow Aradhya to stay and continue participating in the summer camp instead of going to her grandparents' place. Delighted by the children's enthusiasm and their daughter's eagerness to learn, Aradhya's parents readily agreed, cancelling the holiday plans. During her time at the camp, Aradhya made remarkable progress in her reading abilities. Although she could initially read only simple words, by the end of the camp, she had advanced to reading simple stories\u2014an incredible achievement! \n\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Us\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Pratham  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBoard  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLeadership  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPartners  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tPrograms\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEducation  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVocational Training   \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnnual Status of Education Report  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPratham Council For Vulnerable Children  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCovid Response  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLearning Readiness & Catch Up  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLessons from the Pandemic  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tGet Involved\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJob Opportunities  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInternships  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tDelhi Office\t\t\t\t\t\t \nB- 4/59, Safdarjung Enclave\n1st Floor, New Delhi - 110 029\nEmail: info@pratham.org\nContact number: 01141651638\n\n\t\t Mumbai Office \nY.B.

With her mother earning Rs 125/day, education became a distant dream, leading to Jilanba dropping out of school in Grade 10. Her elder brother had to stop his education as well. Grieving for her father, Jilanba stopped doing all the things, like playing kabaddi and listening to music, that made her happy. Opportunity came in the form of Pratham\u2019s Second Chance program. Nikoda village had an active group of volunteers who ran the Hamara Gaon program \u2013 Pratham\u2019s flagship initiative.

She is a mother of two children and her husband is a cab driver. Summaia had never finished school, but always had the desire to complete her education. She didn\u2019t know that she would get a second chance to complete her school education almost 20 years after she left school. Summaia had to drop out of school after Grade 9 due to financial challenges at home and got married early. Busy with household and childcare responsibilities, she never thought she would get back to her studies. When her daughter learned about Pratham's Second Chance program at her tailoring class, she encouraged Summaia to join. The Second Chance program is designed to help women and girls, who couldn't finish school, to complete their Grade 10 exams. Summaia was hesitant to join at first, but she knew that it was her chance to get an education and help her family. Summaia found going back to studies after a long gap difficult. Her classes were held at a cluster centre in her neighborhood. She would go to the class after finishing her household chores. Her husband and mother helped her take care of her children so that she could focus on her studies. But soon, tragedy struck when her mother passed away while she was preparing for the Grade 10 board exam. It was a challenging phase, but she gathered herself and resumed her preparations. In 2022, Summaia took her Grade 10 Board exams. She worked hard and scored an impressive 89%. She was so happy that she had finally achieved her dream of getting an education. Currently, Summaia works at a nutrition centre. She now advises and guides people on leading healthy lives. She is so grateful for the Second Chance program, which gave her the opportunity to get an education and change her life. Summaia's story is an inspiration to others who have had to put their education on hold. She shows that it is never too late to learn and achieve your dreams.

Having dropped out of school after facing the disappointment of failing her Grade 10 exams, her daily life centered around the roles of a dedicated mother and wife, committed to her family and household responsibilities. In 2020, a glimmer of hope entered Tameshwari's life in the form of Pratham's Second Chance Program. This program is designed to empower women and girls who, like Tameshwari, had once left their education incomplete. With unwavering determination, she seized this opportunity, reigniting her educational journey after a hiatus of 15 years. The result? Tameshwari not only completed her Grade 10 exams but did so with distinction. The Second Chance Program offered more than just academic credentials. Through its life skills classes, it nurtured Tameshwari's self-confidence and personal development. With her newfound confidence, she secured a job as a guard in a mall.

She lives with her husband, Suraj Kappa, their four-year-old son, mother-in-law, father-in-law and a sister-in-law. Suraj, who works as a roadside painter, would run into financial hurdles during the monsoon season when his work got stalled. Saraswati, who studied till Grade 9, came in touch with Pratham in November 2021 as part of its Swaad Kart project. The primary goal of this project was to empower women within the target communities by identifying potential entrepreneurs and assisting them in establishing small yet profitable food businesses. At a community meeting held in a nearby village, Saraswati showed keen interest in being trained to run her own food business. This proved to be a turning point in her life. Saraswati and her fellow participants underwent comprehensive training by a team from Pratham\u2019s Entrepreneurship Development program. They learnt various aspects of entrepreneurship such as initiating a business and understanding compliance requirements. The idea was to ensure that the participants gained necessary skills in order to independently operate and sustain their businesses.\u00a0 Saraswati learnt how to make momos and set up a food stall in April 2022. Pratham continued to mentor her till March 2023 and saw to it that her business ran smoothly. Her stall today is a thriving business and she contributes significantly to the family income. Saraswati earns between Rs 500-800 every day and has also managed to save around Rs 15,000 for her son\u2019s education. The Swaad Kart business not only elevated the economic standing of her family but also served as a testament to the transformative potential of empowering women.\u00a0 \n\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Us\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Pratham  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBoard  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLeadership  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPartners  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tPrograms\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEducation  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVocational Training   \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnnual Status of Education Report  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPratham Council For Vulnerable Children  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCovid Response  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLearning Readiness & Catch Up  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLessons from the Pandemic  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tGet Involved\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJob Opportunities  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInternships  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tDelhi Office\t\t\t\t\t\t \nB- 4/59, Safdarjung Enclave\n1st Floor, New Delhi - 110 029\nEmail: info@pratham.org\nContact number: 01141651638\n\n\t\t Mumbai Office \nY.B.

At 23, Jyoti is already shouldering the responsibility of her parents and two younger siblings. Her father, who worked at a neighborhood shop, has not been keeping well recently. Despite the challenges, Jyoti possessed an unwavering spirit and a deep desire to make a difference in her community. It was this passion that led her to Pratham. She first joined Pratham as a volunteer under the Hamara Gaon program. She conducted activities at learning camps and assessments to check the learning levels of children. She joined as a volunteer when she was in Grade 9 and continued the work till Grade 12. She found great joy in working with children and motivated other young individuals in her village to join the volunteer work. \nAfter completing Grade 12 education, Jyoti decided to further enhance her skills by enrolling in a Nursing Assistant course under Pratham's Skilling program. She traveled to the Raipur center, determined to equip herself with the knowledge and training necessary to pursue a career in healthcare. She secured a job at a homecare agency upon completing the course with a starting salary of Rs 9,000 per month. Over time, her commitment and competence earned her a salary raise, and now, she is earning Rs 11,000 per month. Inspired by her sister's progress, Umeshwari, Jyoti's younger sister, also decided to follow in her footsteps. Umeshwari became a volunteer with Pratham, helping children in their educational journey. When Jyoti landed her job at the Homecare agency, she advocated for her sister, assuring the agency that Umeshwari would learn quickly.\u00a0 Jyoti's journey from a small village to the city of Raipur was not without its challenges. Some people back in her village criticized her for venturing out on her own. However, Jyoti remained undeterred, for she knew she had the unwavering support of her family. Her determination and success is an inspiration to other young women. \n\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Us\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Pratham  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBoard  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLeadership  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPartners  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tPrograms\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEducation  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVocational Training   \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnnual Status of Education Report  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPratham Council For Vulnerable Children  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCovid Response  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLearning Readiness & Catch Up  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLessons from the Pandemic  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tGet Involved\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJob Opportunities  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInternships  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tDelhi Office\t\t\t\t\t\t \nB- 4/59, Safdarjung Enclave\n1st Floor, New Delhi - 110 029\nEmail: info@pratham.org\nContact number: 01141651638\n\n\t\t Mumbai Office \nY.B.

They are implemented on a large scale to not only reach as many children as possible, but also to enable an adoptable demonstration model for governments and other partners.

The program focuses on reforming curriculum, improving classroom practices, developing the capacity of teachers and aiding the state in introducing English as the medium of instruction across state-run educational institutions. The SALT Program is being supported by the World Bank and will be implemented by the Department of School Education (DoSE), Department of Women, Children, Disabled, and Senior Citizens (DoWCDSC), and other state- and district- level administrative units including the SCERT, SIEMAT and the local network of DIETs. Pratham has been selected as a consultant to provide technical support to the Samagra Shiksha State Implementation Society, Govt of Andhra Pradesh for early childhood education to improve foundational learning of children aged 3 to 8 as part of the SALT Program. Pratham will aim to implement the SALT program through localized, state-context-aligned activities and innovations for improving the quality of education in government schools. This will be done, in part, through (i) development of a transformational roadmap for the early childhood education and foundational learning continuum, (ii) building the capacities of Anganwadi workers, preparatory class teachers and early grade teachers, and (iii) developing model Anganwadi centres and primary school across all districts of the state. Overview of the PositionPratham is looking to hire a Program Associate for the implementation of the SALT Program. The Associate will work with 5 other Associates to manage the program across all 13 districts (26 new districts) in the state.

The Associate will be a crucial link between the planning and the implementation teams working on the SALT Program and through this project, will have the opportunity to build a holistic understanding of the educational ecosystem from people with rich experience and knowledge in the field, both internally and externally.

About the Girls and Women ProgramsPratham\u2019s research and experience shows that barriers, such as lack of confidence in their own abilities, poor or non-existent foundational and applied skills, coupled with a general lack of information about employment and livelihood pathways, about life events and opportunities, influence girls\u2019 and women\u2019s willingness and abilities to seek and access education and employment opportunities.

For more details, refer to www.pratham.org. \nAbout Pratham\u2019s Girls and Women Program\nPratham\u2019s research and experience shows that barriers, such as lack of confidence in their own abilities, poor or non-existent foundational and applied skills, coupled with a general lack of information about employment and livelihood pathways, about life events and opportunities, influence girls\u2019 and women\u2019s willingness and abilities to seek and access education and employment opportunities. This situation is rooted in and perpetuated by a set of social norms and expectations that frame what is thought of as appropriate behaviours and roles for girls and women. Pratham\u2019s flagship program Second Chance is a year-long intervention which aims to help dropouts, especially girls and women, restart their education and complete secondary schooling. The program provided academic support to learners to help them prepare and appear for Grade 10 examination through Open Schooling Institutions or State Education Boards; learners also get exposure to life skills and similar co-scholastic modules which can enhance their skillset and help in their personal and professional journey. Started in 2011, the program is operational across 12 States in India and has reached more than 40,000 girls and women. The program is headed by a core team which is based across Ahmedabad, Delhi and Mumbai.\nRemote Second Chance (RSCP), an initiative under the Second Chance program, aims to use technology and its advantages to reach out to more interested learners remotely to help them prepare for the board exam. It started in 2019 and is at the stage of scaling up. \nPosition Summary: \nMinimum 2 years commitment required (Can be extended based on performance) Reporting: Second Chance Program Head for Ahmedabad location.\nApplication Process: Send the following to prachi.uikey@pratham.org and mention \u2018Application\u2019 in the subject line. \n\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Us\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Pratham  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBoard  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLeadership  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPartners  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tPrograms\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEducation  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVocational Training   \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnnual Status of Education Report  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPratham Council For Vulnerable Children  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCovid Response  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLearning Readiness & Catch Up  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLessons from the Pandemic  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tGet Involved\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJob Opportunities  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInternships  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tDelhi Office\t\t\t\t\t\t \nB- 4/59, Safdarjung Enclave\n1st Floor, New Delhi - 110 029\nEmail: info@pratham.org\nContact number: 01141651638\n\n\t\t Mumbai Office \nY.B.

About the Girls and Women ProgramsPratham\u2019s research and experience shows that barriers, such as lack of confidence in their own abilities, poor or non-existent foundational and applied skills, coupled with a general lack of information about employment and livelihood pathways, about life events and opportunities, influence girls\u2019 and women\u2019s willingness and abilities to seek and access education and employment opportunities.

Moving forward, Pratham will focus on bringing together content and activities for \u201clearning for school\u201d, \u201clearning for life\u201d and \u201clearning for work\u201d in order to build effective pathways for girls and women to transition successfully into the next stage of life.

She lives with her father, Raju, a farmer; her mother, a homemaker; and her younger sister, Gudiya, who is in Grade 3. With another sibling on the way, her mother was not in the best of health and relied heavily on Aarti for household chores, often causing her to miss school. When Pratham\u2019s thirty days learning camp started in October 2023 at Aarti\u2019s school, her attendance was sporadic. The school teacher confirmed her frequent absences, raising concerns about her academic progress. A Pratham team member visited Aarti\u2019s home and discovered that her absences were due to her need to help with household responsibilities, especially as her mother was expecting another child and was not well. During the home visit, the Pratham team member assessed Aarti's learning level in front of her parents. It became evident that Aarti struggled with reading and basic math. Her parents were initially skeptical about the value of regular school attendance, believing she wasn\u2019t learning much anyway. However, after learning about Pratham\u2019s engaging and effective methodologies, they were persuaded to send Aarti to school daily. Aarti began attending the learning camp, a short, intensive teaching-learning initiative conducted by Pratham staff with support from the school and community to help children catch up and improve their learning levels. Children are grouped by learning ability rather than grade, using tailored methods and materials for rapid, impactful progress. Aarti became engaged with the interactive and enjoyable learning activities in the camp. She particularly enjoyed listening to stories and participating in warm-up exercises, which sparked her interest in learning. Despite her initial enthusiasm, Aarti's mother once again started keeping her at home to help with chores. Another visit by a Pratham team member highlighted Aarti's noticeable progress \u2014 she was starting to read, albeit with some difficulty. Witnessing her daughter's improvement, Aarti's mother was convinced to allow her to attend the camp daily. With Pratham's support, Aarti progressed remarkably. She started managing her household responsibilities in the morning, ensuring support to her mother before attending the learning camp. Her confidence soared as her reading and math skills improved. By the end of the camp, Aarti could read stories and solve basic addition problems. She even joined the community children\u2019s club, where she participated in daily learning activities. Aarti's happiness was palpable as she shared her newfound skills. She took pride in being able to read and understand her lessons and was excited to share stories with her younger sister and her newborn brother. Her mother expressed her gratitude, saying, \u201cWe used to think there was no point in sending her to school if she couldn\u2019t read or understand what was being taught, but now we have realised that regular attendance at school can help. The learning camp has taught her to read.\u201d Aarti's journey is a testament to the impact of Pratham\u2019s learning camps. Her story highlights the importance of regular attendance and the right learning support. \n\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Us\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Pratham  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBoard  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLeadership  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPartners  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tPrograms\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEducation  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVocational Training   \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnnual Status of Education Report  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPratham Council For Vulnerable Children  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCovid Response  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLearning Readiness & Catch Up  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLessons from the Pandemic  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tGet Involved\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJob Opportunities  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInternships  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tDelhi Office\t\t\t\t\t\t \nB- 4/59, Safdarjung Enclave\n1st Floor, New Delhi - 110 029\nEmail: info@pratham.org\nContact number: 01141651638\n\n\t\t Mumbai Office \nY.B.

A Grade 6 student, she lives with her elder siblings. Her brother Shikari (19) and her sister Anjali (16) had to drop out of school due to the family\u2019s financial condition. Her father, Jeetu Mahato, is a single parent and works as a daily wage labourer in another state. It is her siblings who take care of Saraswati at home. Saraswati harbours dreams of becoming a doctor, however, the environment at home is not conducive to encourage learning. She frequently missed school to help her sister with household chores. In August 2023, Saraswati\u2019s school teacher, along with some Pratham officials became concerned about her learning struggles during a baseline assessment that was conducted for students in her class. At Grade 6,\u00a0 Saraswati could only identify letters, instead of reading and comprehending stories, and recognise numbers from zero to nine in Math. The baseline assessment (a pre-test to understand children\u2019s current learning levels) was done as part of the BASIC (Baseline Advancement of Students for Improved Capacity) initiative by the district administration of the Khunti district, Jharkhand with support from Pratham. This initiative runs across 54 schools in Jharkhand\u2019s Khunti district and aims to assess the learning levels of Grade 6 to 8 students and support them in their learning journey. In order to address Saraswati\u2019s learning needs, her teacher along with Pratham officials met the teenager\u2019s father at home and discussed the challenges she was facing. Saraswati\u2019s father, in turn, admitted that they were not able to support her in studies at home. Saraswati\u2019s teacher and Pratham representatives also formed a children\u2019s group in the village and made her the leader of the group. The children in this group were given daily learning worksheets to complete. Sarawati\u2019s sister Anjali became a volunteer and started supporting children with their learning. Apart from building basic arithmetic and reading skills, Saraswati was involved in group activities that covered the topics of health, hygiene, types of waste and how to recycle them. These activities boosted her confidence and instilled in her curiosity to learn more. At school too, Saraswati did various fun learning activities to improve her reading, writing and arithmetic skills as part of the BASIC classes that were held along with her regular classes. Over time, her fear of learning diminished and Saraswati began taking a keen interest in studies. She also completed the worksheets along with other children in the neighbourhood after coming home from school. When the endline assessment (a post-test to understand the learning improvements) was done in December 2023, Saraswati was able to read stories and perform simple Math operations. When Anjali (Saraswati\u2019s sister and volunteer) was asked about her thoughts on Saraswati\u2019s learning improvements, she said, \u201cWe could not continue our education due to financial constraints, but we will make sure that Saraswati does not drop out of school. Seeing her passion for learning, we will provide her with all possible support.\u201d Today, Saraswati is confident that she will bring her dream of becoming a doctor to fruition. \n\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Us\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Pratham  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBoard  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLeadership  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPartners  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tPrograms\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEducation  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVocational Training   \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnnual Status of Education Report  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPratham Council For Vulnerable Children  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCovid Response  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLearning Readiness & Catch Up  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLessons from the Pandemic  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tGet Involved\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJob Opportunities  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInternships  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tDelhi Office\t\t\t\t\t\t \nB- 4/59, Safdarjung Enclave\n1st Floor, New Delhi - 110 029\nEmail: info@pratham.org\nContact number: 01141651638\n\n\t\t Mumbai Office \nY.B.

But as a Grade 3 student last year, he was only able to read letters and solve simple addition problems. Pawan lives with his parents, a brother and a sister. His father, Hiralal, studied till Grade 6, and his mother, Manbhar, attended school till Grade 2. Pawan\u2019s brother, Dilkhush, is studying in Grade 9 and sister, Pooja, is a Grade 6 student. In November 2023, a Pratham representative visited Pawan\u2019s home and found out that his parents were unaware of the boy\u2019s learning struggles. The Pratham team then took a two-pronged approach \u2014 involving Pawan\u2019s parents in his learning journey and finding ways to support his studies. \u00a0 Pawan was enrolled into a learning camp conducted by Pratham for Grade 3-5 students from November to December, 2023. Children at the camp were grouped according to their learning levels rather than grades and within these groups, targeted teaching-learning activities were conducted. Over the days, Pawan\u2019s interest in studies grew. During the language classes, learning activities such as mind-mapping, word games etc were done at the camp. Similarly, during the Math classes, activities like number chart, tilli (sticks)-bundle game, and others were conducted. Realising the importance of his mother\u2019s involvement in Pawan\u2019s studies, the Pratham team also convinced Pawan\u2019s mother to be part of a Mothers\u2019 Group in the community. As part of the group, she was taught various learning activities to do with her children at home. She soon began supporting Pawan with reading and basic Mathematics operations at home. She also helped him understand classification by colours, encouraged him to learn poetry, storytelling, and sentence formation, etc. Pawan started doing worksheets at home with his mother\u2019s support. Meanwhile, the Pratham team made multiple visits to Pawan\u2019s home and his siblings also began supporting him in studies. With a conducive learning environment, Pawan\u2019s confidence slowly grew and his attendance improved significantly. He also excelled in group activities and completed his daily homework. Today, Pawan is able to read stories, do subtraction, and solve word problems. He has also been promoted to Grade 4 this year and goes to school regularly. Pawan\u2019s story showcases how, with the right support at home and school, one can find courage and take big leaps in learning. \n\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Us\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Pratham  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBoard  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLeadership  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPartners  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tPrograms\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEducation  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVocational Training   \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnnual Status of Education Report  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPratham Council For Vulnerable Children  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCovid Response  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLearning Readiness & Catch Up  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLessons from the Pandemic  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tGet Involved\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJob Opportunities  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInternships  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tDelhi Office\t\t\t\t\t\t \nB- 4/59, Safdarjung Enclave\n1st Floor, New Delhi - 110 029\nEmail: info@pratham.org\nContact number: 01141651638\n\n\t\t Mumbai Office \nY.B.

Sanvi\u2019s father\u2019s meagre income covers all financial responsibilities of the household, but he harbours big dreams for his children; he wants them to receive an education and secure government jobs. Sanvi\u2019s parents were aware of the necessity of English language skills for employment, but she had developed a fear of the language. Moreover, her parents couldn\u2019t afford a private tutor. An opportunity came knocking when Pratham\u2019s volunteers visited their doorstep, mobilising children for the English Winter Camp. Initially hesitant and shy, Sanvi faced challenges with fluency and pronunciation, but with a zeal for learning and guidance from dedicated volunteers, she began practicing tasks each day at the camp. Through community engagement, the English Winter Camp, \u2018Fun with English 2.0\u2019, aimed to encourage children to learn English by making it fun and interesting, thereby eliminating their fear of the language. Sanvi became focused and active in warm-up activities and games, and her parents noticed a change in her spoken English skills. Daily practices of warm-up activities, audio stories, and games brought remarkable improvements in their speaking, reading, and writing skills, and Sanvi\u2019s fear of the English language began to diminish. As Sanvi stood reciting lines with fluency and precision, her parents felt that this program should run every three months so that children can continue to practice and make further progress in spoken English. \u201cSanvi knew very little English before attending the camp; now she can form sentences, and her fear towards learning the language has also disappeared,\" her father says. \n\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Us\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Pratham  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBoard  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLeadership  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPartners  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tPrograms\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEducation  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVocational Training   \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnnual Status of Education Report  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPratham Council For Vulnerable Children  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCovid Response  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLearning Readiness & Catch Up  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLessons from the Pandemic  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tGet Involved\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJob Opportunities  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInternships  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tDelhi Office\t\t\t\t\t\t \nB- 4/59, Safdarjung Enclave\n1st Floor, New Delhi - 110 029\nEmail: info@pratham.org\nContact number: 01141651638\n\n\t\t Mumbai Office \nY.B.

Due to her family\u2019s financial situation, she had to drop out of school after Grade 8. Her father worked as a farmhand and income was irregular, which left her mother as the sole provider of the family. Kaleena gave up on her educational dreams so that her younger sister could complete college. Happiness, however, eluded her even after marriage. She had a difficult marriage. It was only after the birth of her second child that Kaleena found the strength to leave her husband. Their separation marked a new beginning for Kaleena and her children \u2014 Khushi (7 years) and Yachna (10 years). Determined to rebuild her life, Kaleena trained as a beautician and started stitching clothes at home to support her family. At the time, her mother shouldered the farm responsibilities while her father worked at a steel factory in Raipur, and visited them occasionally. In 2021, Pratham approached mothers from Kaleena\u2019s village to form a Mothers\u2019 Group and support their children\u2019s learning. Kaleena was selected to be the \u2018leader mother\u2019 since she assisted other mothers in understanding and conducting learning activities for their children. Pratham provided the mothers with idea cards, activity suggestions and worksheets for their children. For mothers who couldn\u2019t attend the meetings, Kaleena was tasked to visit their homes and demonstrate the activities. \u201cWe do not hesitate to talk to others or make simple decisions anymore. Seeing other mothers understand their worth and come forward to fulfill their children\u2019s dreams makes me very happy. I want each mother to know her worth. If they are determined, they can do anything,\u201d she said. The impact has been profound. Children, once shy, now exhibit enthusiasm for learning, while mothers revel in their newfound confidence. Inspired by the profound changes she witnessed, Kaleena decided to chase her dreams further. In 2023, she enrolled in Pratham\u2019s Second Chance program to complete her Grade 10. In 2024, she cleared Grade 10 exam and wants to study further. She has even encouraged a few mothers in her village to join the Second Chance program. Today, Kaleena is a new version of herself. Her story echoes beyond her personal triumph and it\u2019s an inspiration for other mothers in the village. She is no longer under the control of circumstances and makes her own decisions.\u00a0 \n\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Us\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Pratham  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBoard  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLeadership  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPartners  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tPrograms\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEducation  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVocational Training   \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnnual Status of Education Report  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPratham Council For Vulnerable Children  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCovid Response  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLearning Readiness & Catch Up  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLessons from the Pandemic  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tGet Involved\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJob Opportunities  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInternships  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tDelhi Office\t\t\t\t\t\t \nB- 4/59, Safdarjung Enclave\n1st Floor, New Delhi - 110 029\nEmail: info@pratham.org\nContact number: 01141651638\n\n\t\t Mumbai Office \nY.B.

Hailing from a modest background in Pune\u2019s slum area, Maharashtra, Pallavi faced financial constraints that forced her to discontinue her education after Grade 8 in 2008. She decided to help her family financially. Three years after dropping out of school, she was offered a lifeline by Pratham\u2019s Second Chance team, providing her with an opportunity to complete her secondary education. Eagerly enrolling in the program, she attended classes at the center, not only acquiring knowledge and new friendships but also reigniting her passion for higher education. Pallavi passed Grade X exams with an impressive 70% score in 2012. However, financial challenges continued to loom over her. Fortunately, she was selected for an educational sponsorship from the Suprabhat Mahila Mandal, an NGO dedicated to supporting students\u2019 education in Pune. This support enabled Pallavi to complete her Grade XII in 2014 with a score of 75%. She fondly recalls the guidance and motivation from her mentors, especially Vandana Tai, who became a beacon of inspiration for her. Pallavi\u2019s mentors facilitated a paid internship for her which eventually transformed into a full-time job, encouraging her to pursue higher education while balancing work and studies. Her time at the company allowed Pallavi to explore different aspects of the business, fostering a deep interest in HR and Accounts. She wanted to get an MBA. Yet, the \u201cexternal\u201d tag on her M.Com marksheet, indicating her non-attendance in a regular college for the course, troubled her. In 2021, Pallavi decided to take a sabbatical from work to enroll in a regular MBA programme at Pune University. She became the first postgraduate in her family. Serving as a role model for her younger siblings, who also completed their education, Pallavi\u2019s success brought immense pride to her mother, a strong advocate for her education. Pallavi firmly believes in the transformative power of education, recognizing its ability to instill confidence and unveil one\u2019s true potential. \n\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Us\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Pratham  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBoard  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLeadership  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPartners  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tPrograms\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEducation  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVocational Training   \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnnual Status of Education Report  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPratham Council For Vulnerable Children  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCovid Response  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLearning Readiness & Catch Up  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLessons from the Pandemic  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tGet Involved\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJob Opportunities  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInternships  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tDelhi Office\t\t\t\t\t\t \nB- 4/59, Safdarjung Enclave\n1st Floor, New Delhi - 110 029\nEmail: info@pratham.org\nContact number: 01141651638\n\n\t\t Mumbai Office \nY.B.

Anju\u2019s eldest daughter used to go to the Anganwadi center in 2014-15, but she was unhappy with the way the activities were conducted and it did not enhance her daughter\u2019s learning growth. Her daughter had trouble speaking in Hindi since Tamil was the language spoken at home. Anju was forced to take her out of the Anganwadi and send her to a play school. Anju's middle daughter started to go to the Anganwadi in 2019, and that is when Anju became associated with Pratham. The activities conducted with Pratham's staff engaged her daughter, and she learned a lot. Her spoken language and diction improved, and she learned counting, identifying colors, and more.

She lives with her father, who is a farmer, her mother, a homemaker, and her two younger siblings. Coming from a marginalized background, opportunities did not come easily to her. Her father\u2019s income was barely enough to make ends meet. Amid such dire financial situation, Sarojani was forced to sacrifice her education. She dropped out of school after Grade 9 and began looking for work. However, it proved to be a challenge since she hadn\u2019t completed her education and lacked professional skills. During the COVID-19 lockdown, she heard about the automotive course under Pratham Skilling from her friends and enrolled for an online course. It didn\u2019t bother her that she was the only girl in the class; she was determined to complete the course. While doing the course, Sarojani started looking for a garage where she could practice everything she learned in the class. She met the owner of Geeta Garage in Bilaigarh and convinced him to hire her. The on-the-job training helped her hone her skills and learn more about servicing automobiles. The owner of the garage was impressed with her dedication and hard work and offered her a permanent job. She started with a salary of INR 4,000 per month. At the time, Pratham had asked her if she was interested in joining the organization. That, however, involved relocating to Raipur, the capital city of Chhattisgarh, and she was reluctant to move out of her village. Almost a month ago, Sarojani\u2019s father suffered a paralytic attack. As a result, her burden of responsibility increased. She was not only responsible for the household expenses but also for the education of her siblings. Pratham again approached her, offering the job of an assistant trainer at the Raipur Automotive Centre. This time, she accepted the offer with a monthly salary of INR 13.5K. After joining work, Sarojani recently enrolled in Pratham\u2019s Second Chance Program to complete her Grade 10 exams. \n\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Us\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Pratham  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBoard  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLeadership  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPartners  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tPrograms\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEducation  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVocational Training   \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnnual Status of Education Report  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPratham Council For Vulnerable Children  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCovid Response  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLearning Readiness & Catch Up  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLessons from the Pandemic  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tGet Involved\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJob Opportunities  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInternships  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tDelhi Office\t\t\t\t\t\t \nB- 4/59, Safdarjung Enclave\n1st Floor, New Delhi - 110 029\nEmail: info@pratham.org\nContact number: 01141651638\n\n\t\t Mumbai Office \nY.B.

As the eldest among three siblings, she was a role model to her younger siblings. She was a star student and made her family proud by scoring 86% in her Grade VIII examinations. However, misfortune struck the family when her father suffered a paralytic attack. Soon after, her mother was diagnosed with an intestinal disorder and her younger brother was affected by a nervous disorder. Amid these challenging conditions, Siddhi had to make the tough decision of dropping out of school to support her family financially. In 2012, after discontinuing her studies, Siddhi started tailoring work. During a community mobilization drive in 2016, Siddhi and her family met Pratham\u2019s team and learned about the Second Chance Program. She feared that she might not be able to clear Grade 10 exams after a three-year gap, but her family gave her the much-needed encouragement to enroll in the program. Initially, when she struggled with basic concepts, she questioned her decision of joining the program. However, as the course progressed and started delving into subject-wise curriculum, Siddhi's interest piqued. She started attending classes regularly, while managing her familial responsibilities. She scored 76% in her board exams. Pratham's Second Chance program was a turning point in her life. Siddhi gradually became ambitious and decided to study further. She started her higher secondary classes while supporting her studies with her tailoring work. Due to family constraints, it took her two years to complete Grade XII in 2019 through open school. She also supported the Pisangan block as a facilitator. Currently, she is pursuing her Bachelor's in Arts. She's also been the Subject Content and Teaching Assistant of Home Science in the Rajasthan Second Chance program since October 2020.\u00a0 Her journey from being a student to a state content expert serves as an example to young girls and women who have dropped out of school, whom she encounters during community mobilization drives. She says that she was inspired by her teachers in Second Chance, and now it's her motive to extend similar support to other girls and women. \n\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Us\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Pratham  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBoard  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLeadership  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPartners  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tPrograms\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEducation  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVocational Training   \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnnual Status of Education Report  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPratham Council For Vulnerable Children  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCovid Response  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLearning Readiness & Catch Up  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLessons from the Pandemic  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tGet Involved\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJob Opportunities  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInternships  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tDelhi Office\t\t\t\t\t\t \nB- 4/59, Safdarjung Enclave\n1st Floor, New Delhi - 110 029\nEmail: info@pratham.org\nContact number: 01141651638\n\n\t\t Mumbai Office \nY.B.

As one of the largest non-governmental organizations in the country, Pratham focuses on high-quality, low-cost, and replicable interventions to address gaps in the education system. Established in 1995 to provide education to children in the slums of Mumbai, Pratham has grown both in scope and geographical coverage. Pratham means 'first' in Sanskrit. True to its name, it is the first major organization to achieve lasting, wide-scale success in India's educational landscape. This has been made possible due to various policies and strategies adopted by the organization. The mission to improve the quality of education in India and ensure that all children not only attend but also thrive in school is being accomplished by working in collaboration with the government, local communities, parents, teachers, volunteers, and civil society members. Our programs aim to supplement rather than replace governmental efforts. They are implemented on a large scale to not only reach as many children as possible, but also to create an adoptable demonstration model for state governments. Pratham\u2019s strategies reconfigure teaching methodologies, break down traditional tactics,\nand challenge the current rote learning mechanisms in our schools. Our programs are innovative and outcome-driven. In its early years Pratham developed innovative teaching-learning approaches, materials, and measurement methods. In 2005, we pioneered a nationwide survey of schooling and learning that has had a major impact on national and international policy discussions. Pratham has worked to develop low-cost, replicable models that can easily spread and be adopted by other organizations. Thousands of volunteers work with Pratham to implement learning interventions at the grassroots level. These volunteers are mobilized, trained, and monitored by the Pratham team. They are also provided with teaching-learning material and books developed by Pratham. Not only does this ensure more effective implementation of the programs, but it also helps to build an infrastructure focused on providing quality education to children. All programs are designed to ensure that learning levels in schools and communities increase, education reaches all children who are in school or unable to use school facilities, and youth get well trained for job opportunities. Testing tools are also developed by the Pratham team to check the learning levels of children so as to determine the course of action best suited to each child and to assess impact of our programs. Over the years, Pratham's advocacy in the education sector has become well recognized and regarded. The Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) has become an important input in the education policies of both the central and state governments with several state governments using \n\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Us\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Pratham  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBoard  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLeadership  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPartners  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tPrograms\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEducation  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVocational Training   \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnnual Status of Education Report  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPratham Council For Vulnerable Children  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCovid Response  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLearning Readiness & Catch Up  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLessons from the Pandemic  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tGet Involved\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJob Opportunities  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInternships  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tDelhi Office\t\t\t\t\t\t \nB- 4/59, Safdarjung Enclave\n1st Floor, New Delhi - 110 029\nEmail: info@pratham.org\nContact number: 01141651638\n\n\t\t Mumbai Office \nY.B.

Suman Bhattacharjea, Director (Research), ASER Centre co-wrote an article published on UNESCO \u2018s World Education Blog. It stresses on the need for internationally comparable data on early-grade literacy and numeracy.  In a new blog, Rukmini Banerji and Mamta Murthi, Vice President, Human Development, World Bank, tell us how learning poverty can be tackled using scalable interventions and community-driven initiatives. Bridging the divide between parental understandings of schooling and learning filled a missing link in children\u2019s education and has paved the way for ongoing parental engagement in children\u2019s education, which is overwhelmingly positive. Dr Rukmini Banerji was invited to speak at TEDx IIM Ahmedabad. In her TED talk, she emphasises on the importance of foundational learning and implementation of NEP 2020.   In the two-part podcast series \u2018Grassroots Nation\u2019,  Dr Madhav Chavan and Dr Rukmini Banerji talk about Pratham\u2019s origin, its expansion and core values  The chapter outlines how Pratham went from designing methods to understand the learning crisis to developing solutions that were then used at scale across the country. \u201cThe important point was to solve the problem.

Now there are rooms with open space where teachers and children can organise themselves in whatever way they want. Dr. Rukmini Banerji, CEO of Pratham Education Foundation, talks about how ASER has become more than just a data collection.

Teachers have attempted to send children learning materials using whatever means were available. At their end, families have tried to support the education of their children in the best way they could. Yet, there is widespread agreement that these efforts have been largely ineffective and significantly uneven. Across the globe, there is serious concern about whether all children will come back to school when once schools reopen. Schools, families, and policymakers are worried about the impact of the pandemic on children\u2019s socio-emotional development and the extent of learning loss that may have occurred.  As far as schooling is concerned, the COVID crisis has brought unprecedented challenges: for example, children who are enrolled in Grade II today have never been to school and possibly have not had much exposure to pre-school education either. Children in today\u2019s Grade V were finishing Grade III when the pandemic struck. Data from India indicates that even in 2018, more than half of all children in Grade IV could not read a Grade II level text or perform simple 2-digit subtraction. It is very likely at the situation will have worsened in the past year and a half.\n By June-July in a regular year, summer vacations are over, and schools have re-opened after the holidays. Children look forward to this time. Keeping in mind this usual school calendar timeline, and aligned with the expectations of children, parents, and teachers, we at Pratham feel it is time for learning to begin again \u2013 and importantly, in a fun and engaging way!  To this end, whether schools open or not, during August & September Pratham will carry out a community-based learning campaign in over 10,000 rural and urban communities across the country. The campaign rolled out across the country in the beginning of August 2021, and is encouraging parents and family members as well as others in the community to join children, engage with them in interesting and fun activities, and help them learn.  The campaign has two focus areas: (1)\u00a0 Early years learning readiness for children currently in Grade I and II; via mothers individually and in groups (2) \u201cCatch up\u201d campaign for children currently in Grade III to VI via local volunteers who conduct instructional activities and games with small groups in the neighborhood. Volunteers or youth are conducting Mohalla Math Learning Camp this month and will be conducting the Mohalla Language Learning Camp in September to help children build/re-build foundational reading and math skills. The campaign will be carried out in over 10,000 communities in August and September. Given the uncertainty around movement due to the pandemic, the team is working through multiple scenarios as described below. Based on the experiences of the past year, there are three likely scenarios outlined below: It is likely that any of these scenarios may prevail at any time, and hence the education sector needs to be prepared. After a year of school closure, we should be in a position to answer questions like What kind of activities are possible in each scenario? And with what kind of outcomes? Here are the possible scenarios: Pratham\u2019s current community learning campaign will contribute to finding some of these answers in the next few months, especially in terms of what can be achieved in communities by local people. \u00a0In addition to the primary goal of addressing children\u2019s learning needs, Pratham is also initiating special exercises for community volunteers so that capability for digital interactions is enhanced in these communities for future work. As part of Pratham\u2019s Education for Education program (EfE), volunteers who give time for helping children learn are being offered a basic course in digital literacy. The course is available to interested volunteers and mothers. After registering on Pratham Digital\u2019s YouthNet portal, a participant completes the course via online content and assignments. The course will cover basic digital knowledge like: Internet behaviour, WhatsApp, email, zoom and uploading data. Whether schools open or not, keeping safety of all in mind, we hope that Pratham\u2019s community campaign for learning will help young children \u201cleap forward\u201d and older children \u201ccatch up\u201d.\u00a0 These community-based activities can act as a \u201cwarm up\u201d before school opens. A rise in overall digital capability will enable families and communities to support their children and to accompany them on their journey of growth and development, in school and in life.  \u00a0 Pratham is happy to share the community campaign content with any interested individual or organization.

To enable this, we have launched a daily engagement activity titled Karona, Thodi Masti, Thodi Padhai (Do it: A little fun, a little study) that equips parents to continue their child's learning process even during school closure. Through a series of curated SMS and WhatsApp messages, we share text/video/audio content focused on hands-on learning activities.

Children look forward to this time. Keeping in mind this usual school calendar timeline, and aligned with the expectations of children, parents, and teachers, we in Pratham feel it is time for learning to begin again \u2013 and importantly, in a fun and engaging way! The campaign began in the first week of August and is likely to continue till the first week of October. The campaign will have two focus areas: \u201cCatch up\u201d campaign for children currently in Grade III to VI\nA local volunteer conducts simple instructional activities and games with small groups of children in the immediate neighbourhood. This learning camp lasts for an hour and to an hour and a half daily. Currently, the plan is to focus one month on math and one month on reading and associated activities. This effort is aimed at building/re-building foundational reading and math skills for children who have now been out of school for close to a year and a half. Learning readiness for young children currently enrolled in Grade I and II\nThis campaign is primarily being carried out by mothers. In order to equip volunteers to carry out the Mohalla Math Learning Camps with children, a package has been prepared. The package contains basic assessment, guidelines for conducting activities and games (text materials and videos). The package in Hindi is detailed below and can be used to organize activities with children. 10 other languages are available as well. I. Manual: This short manual guides volunteers / facilitators on the camp process and provides an overview of activities to be carried out with children. The manual also describes the materials that will be needed to carry out simple activities & games with children. II. Assessment: Pratham camps begin with a simple, one on one, oral assessment conducted with every child. The math assessment and recording formats can be found here. The assessment is used to understand the level of each child, to track progress of children, and of the group as a whole. III. Activities & Games: Engaging, fun, hands-on activities are at the core of teaching-learning in Pratham camps. These activities help children acquire foundational math skills quickly, and ensure all children make progress, while having fun! Here are some games that can be played with children during camps. And here are some videos to guide volunteers / facilitators on how to conduct activities with children: Math camp videos (Hindi) IV. SMS-based activities: In addition to camp activities, children can also be engaged through daily SMS content that are shared directly with parents via phone. These home activities support the mohalla camps. A package of daily SMS messages for 4 weeks can be found here. V. FAQ: While the activities are simple and easy to follow, there might still be some questions! Here is a list of Frequently Asked Questions to help those who may need clarifications. More questions?

My name is Arjun and I have been a part of the Program Management Group at Pratham. Our team is at a rather interesting niche in the organization \u2013 we interact with donors and manage those relationships, while also working with and supporting field teams on program planning and implementation. My three years at Pratham have been a rollercoaster. From spending hours on train stations to eating guinea pigs in Peru to conducting elections in a village in Uttar Pradesh, Pratham has exposed me to a range of experiences that I could never have imagined. As I look back at my time in the organization, while there have been (plenty of!) moments of frustration, I would not have had it any other way. I landed in Patna on a warm October night and caught a train to a district called Jamui on the edge of the state. The purpose of my trip was to visit a cluster of villages where local leaders had taken the initiative to work on children\u2019s learning. I met the cluster head with Gunjan (the Pratham staff member leading the initiative), and asked him what he would do if Pratham teams moved on from that area. He responded that they would manage on their own and that he would be that area\u2019s Gunjan. This completely blew me away. Later, I sat under the stars talking to villagers about their aspirations for children\u2019s learning. Their sheer enthusiasm and passion is forever ingrained in my memory. Not long after this field trip, I found myself on a plane to Peru. Our team was helping the Peruvian government pilot Pratham\u2019s teaching-learning approach in some rural schools. After a fair amount of travel, I reached a school in rural Cajamarca. It was morning, and the day\u2019s activities were about to begin. I saw two boys come out of the classroom, collect some stones, and start playing the \u2018number wheel\u2019 game. This activity is designed to help them understand the concept of place value and had been taught in class the previous day. This was really amazing! After my time in Peru, I returned to India and soon went back in Patna visiting new locations. The excitement of seeing people from India to Peru use, adapt and implement our approach fueled me and kept me awake, despite the jetlag. When I look back at my time with Pratham, it has been the opportunity to work together with an extremely diverse group of individuals that has been one of the biggest highlights. From field staff in a corner of Bihar to leadership teams sitting in Delhi and Mumbai, the organization has allowed me to interact with\u2013and more importantly learn from\u2013a most incredible and passionate set of individuals. By working on programs and developing collaborations with governments (in India or elsewhere), Pratham has given me the chance to really drive change and make my voice count. More than anything though, it has shown me the power of clear and focused action and convinced me that ambitious leaps in outcomes are possible in a future not too far from us. And that\u2019s really exciting. - Arjun WHAT MAKES PRATHAM CLICK I gaze at a book called In Search of Excellence on my table, written by two ex-McKinsey consultants on what makes great \u2018corporations\u2019 click and I\u2019m left in awe as to how Pratham, an NGO, has so intuitively, over and over again for the better part of the last two decades, managed to create an environment where everything just clicks.  Around this time last year, I knew little about the development sector. I\u2019d worked for two years in a consulting firm and was ready to apply my obligation to dissent to a bigger context. Tired of castigating our politicians during after-work parties, I decided it was vital for me to get a sense of how things worked on the ground. At the same time, I wanted to stick to my core skill of data analysis. Measurement, Monitoring and Evaluation seemed like a natural fit, and Pratham\u2019s work in the area immediately caught my attention.  Humble Beginnings When I joined in October 2017, I was fortunate enough to be trusted with Pratham\u2019s flagship program, called Read India. I was told I\u2019d be collaborating with more than 40 people from 10 states across India, which at the time seemed quite overwhelming! As I spent time with state-level MME teams, I realized how much effort Pratham had put in to cultivate a strong cadre of leaders in every state, an achievement few NGOs can boast of today. Data is often conveniently left out of the conversation in the social sector, yet here I was in an environment where people close to the field were discussing how our intervention could be more effective if some additional indicators were added to our monitoring formats1. I was humbled and elated to witness how strongly people in Pratham--whether our leadership in Delhi or a staff member in a remote village in Rajasthan--believed in the power of data to make better decisions.  Getting Into the Groove  In April 2018, Pratham decided to \u00a0shift its focus from learning in schools to learning in communities. The goal, broadly defined, was to better understand learning levels of all children in a village and work towards improving those, involving community members in the process. That is no small task when working in 14 different states (~3500 villages) with such diversity in contexts. However, we realized we could either be discouraged by the massive scale and complexity of this problem or break it down into simpler pieces. The first step? Making sure community members understood the problem of poor learning levels in the first place. The solution we came up with was a village report card, an assessment of their own community\u2019s learning levels led by village volunteers. From designing the report card to piloting and translating it to training team members at the state level who then conducted volunteer trainings, I was given complete freedom to call the shots. In a span of 30 days, volunteers collected data from 100,000 children across ~480 villages in 14 states2. Further, close to 70% of this data was collected on a tablet-based application we built within a week\u2019s time! Somehow, yet again, things just clicked! From our CEO to everyone on ground, it was heartening to get such tremendous support from all ranks of the organisation, all aligned toward a unified goal. I was doing some great work a year back too, but could I compare any of it to this exercise? I doubt it. Every Child Learning Well As I pause the music on my phone, my colleague from our Assessment Unit excitedly shares that one of our co-founders, Dr. Madhav Chavan, plans to make learning modules on music for rural children to access via Android tablets in their villages. \u2018Why limit our work to Math and Science?\u2019, he says. Another new day, another new idea, another new experiment; \u00a0practicing our obligation to dissent against traditional beliefs about education. \u00a0This pretty much sums up the one year I\u2019ve spent at Pratham. People around me might be from a variety of backgrounds, but it is our unshakeable faith in every child learning well that, I guess, makes Pratham click!  \u00a0 - Eshan THE MAGIC OF PRATHAM My journey with Pratham started in May of 2012, and although it has been some time now, Pratham still makes every day feel anew. Pratham was my first job out of university, so I was eager to absorb as well as apply my psychology degree in the real world. Over time, Pratham has gifted me with the opportunity to work in various capacities. I started in the People Development Unit, where I contributed to the creation of capacity building programs for people within Pratham. Most importantly, this first position taught be that training can be a \u2018tool for change\u2019. As I gained experience, I began creating content and training people in conducting Life Skills sessions for adolescents, youth and adults. This profile gave me a chance to develop content for children on various soft skills and also work with many, many teachers across the organization. With the learnings from the aforementioned experiences, I was provided a platform to lead a girls\u2019 education program working with Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalays (KGBVs). KGBVs are residential schools established for girls for girls in Upper primary grades in economically and socially backward blocks of the country. Pratham\u2019s partnership with KGBVs is in three states: Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Jharkhand. Working in these three geographies gives me immense satisfaction and a constant thirst to learn and then concretize my learning. Be it seeing the KGBV girls speak confidently about a Science experiment they learnt, hearing the stories of friendship and collaboration with teachers and wardens or watching the way my own team of 50 women is evolving in the process -- everything has been extremely fulfilling. One of the best things that Pratham helped me understand is how to nurture people. Looking at how my seniors have been with me and how they provided me with a safe space to grow, I learned about the impact that strong, consistent mentorship can have. Pratham works in the field of education, and even internally I\u2019ve been amazed at how much personal and professional growth is possible here. The people in this organization are exceptional at facilitating change, both externally and within. I believe these experiences of warmth and guidance have been instrumental in translating the same in my own work. In my journey of about six years now, Pratham blessed me with three values: trust, passion and resilience. I see these in people at all levels of Pratham, from the central team where I work to the state teams and instructors across the country. \u00a0Pratham trusts its people, the energy within the organization is contagious and whenever we have a set-back, we bounce back with energy! All in all, the Pratham experience is a magical one: there is magic in the work we do, the way we do it, the places Pratham takes us and the contentment at the end of the day! - Sukhada \n\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Us\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Pratham  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBoard  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLeadership  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPartners  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tPrograms\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEducation  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVocational Training   \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnnual Status of Education Report  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPratham Council For Vulnerable Children  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCovid Response  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLearning Readiness & Catch Up  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLessons from the Pandemic  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tGet Involved\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJob Opportunities  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInternships  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tDelhi Office\t\t\t\t\t\t \nB- 4/59, Safdarjung Enclave\n1st Floor, New Delhi - 110 029\nEmail: info@pratham.org\nContact number: 01141651638\n\n\t\t Mumbai Office \nY.B.

While I got to explore many aspects of what PMG does, I mainly worked on research and evaluation components of Pratham\u2019s Early Years interventions. Through this work, I participated in many interesting discussions with donors, research collaborators and teams across the organization, cultivating useful skills throughout. My time in the central office was supplemented by field visits to rural and urban programs in six states, where I could see the successes and challenges of implementation at scale. The learnings from my internship are sure to influence my future, both personally and professionally, and I\u2019m so grateful to the everyone who enhanced my Pratham experience. - Charlotte As a research intern working primarily on government partnerships, I loved the independence I was given to tailor my internship experience and the responsibility to initiate projects that would have a visible impact on Pratham\u2019s collaboration with the government.

Overall, my experience has been extremely rewarding in not only cementing my interest in development, but also helping me build a broad professional skill-set for the sector! - Romasha My summer internship at Pratham proved to be an unmatched learning experience. I was encouraged to get hands-on experience and was presented with multiple opportunities to do field work, reporting, research and even partner meetings - all in the span of just one month.\u00a0 At Pratham I was also encouraged to take initiative and ownership of tasks which helped me grow on a personal and a professional level.

The grant will allow us to aid governments and NGOs in the design and scaling of Pratham\u2019s proven\u00a0Teaching at the Right Level\u00a0(TaRL) approach in multiple countries across Africa, including Ivory Coast, Nigeria and Zambia. This multi-year initiative will help three million primary school children learn to read and do basic arithmetic. What started in a Mumbai slum two and a half decades ago is now taking root on an international scale. Recently, the head of Pratham\u2019s content team, Usha Rane, reported from Niger, where she was leading the training of the local TaRL team. In Africa, like in India, Pratham instructors not only improve schooling and learning but, in doing so, also become deeply engaged with the children and their lives. Below is a firsthand account from Usha of how a set of determined and caring individuals mobilized action around the world to change the life of a child on the verge of blindness. Ibrahim (young boy in Niger): It is summer in Niger, a francophone country in West Africa. Hot summer. Sand floats around everywhere. A school building is mounted on the sand. I can breathe neem tree because I am standing under the only tree which is planted hardly around five meters away from the school. I see more than fifty young children entering the classroom. They are together. They are so much together that they look like one big fish swimming under the water of sand. They are making lots of noise, but they are together. They disappear inside the darkness of the classroom and I follow them with three master trainers in Pratham\u2019s teaching at the right level methodology. Master trainers will conduct the grade I and II activities and I will sit overseeing them with the help of an interpreter.  The children are now quiet. They are somewhat nervous because the master trainer is new to them. Other adults, too, who are sitting on the benches don\u2019t look familiar. The master trainer makes all the children sit on the floor and starts the class activities. I see that the students are listening to him with rapt attention. Now, they have forgotten about our presence and they are giggling, pushing each other to participate in the classroom activities. Almost every child is getting an opportunity to say something either in the whole class activity or in small group activities. One child has caught my attention right from the beginning, but I avoid looking at him. However, again and again, my eyes search for him and I instantly look away. On both his cheeks a small film has gathered. His nose is running too and his eyes are full of tears. I observe this in an instant glance and I feel, \u201cNo, I shouldn\u2019t look at him again.\u201d But the child with foam on his cheeks keeps raising his weak hand and keeps trying to draw the master trainer\u2019s attention in his meek voice. The master trainer avoids him. \u201cWhy am I trying to escape from him?\u201d I ask myself. \u201cNo, I can\u2019t. I should not do this,\u201d I say to myself. I get up from my seat and walk towards him. Actually, I want to clean his face with my dupatta. I want to scrub his face thoroughly. I think for a while and decide to hold his hand. I gently bring him to my desk. He is so weak and fragile that I feel he will just break if I put any force on him. I take out some tissues from my purse and wipe his face. Only few children and the translator notice this, but they don\u2019t say anything. The child goes back. I notice there are no expressions on his face. He is blank, but once again, his eyes are filled with tears. They drop slowly, the lather starts gathering and he gets busy with the classroom process. He tries to raise his hand and wishes to answer, but the master trainer ignores him. He is a boy who won\u2019t give up easily. I admire his drive. He keeps trying but with no luck. The classroom activities are over and there is nobody around me in the classroom. I walk out slowly and look out for Aki.  Aki (Japan International Cooperation Agency \u2013\u00a0JICA) Aki is a tiny, enthusiastic, young JICA employee. She is so very active that I always wonder where she gets her energy from. She has dedicated her life to children in Niger. She has been staying in Niger for many years and I don\u2019t think she has any plans to go back to Tokyo, where her home is. The dusty, sandy Niger has become her home. Aki is busy micromanaging things around her, organizing vehicles to take us to the location where we will have lunch, talking to people around her and giving instructions to the head teacher who will call the children the next day for practice class. I feel I should not disturb her because she is extremely busy. The Sun is not kind either. I wish to go and sit in the car instantly. But\u2026I hold Aki\u2019s hand and start searching for the child. And while doing this, I tell Aki that I must find this boy. Fortunately, he has not left the school yet. He is waiting for somebody and I rush towards him along with Aki. I tell Aki that I wish to know his name. I also tell her why. The child tells his name to Aki. He is waiting for his elder brother, who is studying in grade III. Aki listens to me intensely keeping all her work aside. I keep looking at her, expecting some positive response or at least a nod of affirmation. I tell her that I wish to help this child. Can he get the best of the best treatment in Niger? Or can we take him to some other country where he will be treated well for his ailment, which is slowly making him completely blind? Aki is thinking. We stand under the tree looking at a far distance in the desert without saying a single word. Breaking her silence, she slowly says, \u201cLet us talk to the head teacher.\u201d Headteacher He is a tall, very smart-looking young man. He can speak very little English and has a very promising smile. Talking to the head teacher is a good idea. He, too, listens to Aki absorbedly. When told about the boy, he looks at me with the utmost disbelief and says I won\u2019t be able to speak to the boy\u2019s father because he is in Benin, a nearby country where poor laborers migrate in search of work. The child\u2019s mother won\u2019t make any decision because she will not step out of her house. She probably doesn\u2019t understand French etc. etc. We keep staring at him. I see a gleam in the corner of his eyes. He smiles and in assuring tone says, \u201cI will send a message for his father. He will come to meet you all the way from Benin.\u201d Ibrahim\u2019s father A landless laborer in his thirties appears before us. He is holding Ibrahim\u2019s hand. He starts speaking, looking at Aki. He speaks for around a half hour. The four of us\u2014Aki, Ibrahim\u2019s father, Ibrahim and I\u2014are standing under the lonely neem tree. The breeze is cooling. He keeps explaining to Aki: what hasn\u2019t he done for this child, how he ran from pillar to post, how each time he was turned away, how difficult it is to feed the family of eight children\u2026. She never translates, but I understand. Then, there is silence. He is not a man who will vociferously say \u201cthank you.\u201d He touches his child\u2019s head and looks up at the sky. The Chinese hospital in Niyame The Chinese government has built a huge hospital with all modern facilities in Niyame. The services are provided at cost, but that is still not free of charge. Aki and I decide that we will first consult the local ophthalmologist, who is associated with the hospital. The doctors at the hospital tell Aki that they will not be able to treat Ibrahim in their hospital. I have to return to India and hence Aki personally starts running around to facilitate the preliminary checkup for Ibrahim. She bears all the costs of pathology while running around with the family from one center to another. Back home in India, I write to my colleagues, friends and relatives. The child\u2019s treatment will need money\u2014a substantial amount. And I get a response. Madhav writes to me, as expected. Madhav (Pratham, India) He writes a to-the-point e-mail. This is his style! He asks some pertinent queries and wants his queries answered quickly. I am in Peru. So Aki, in her Japanese accent with a heavy French intonation, explains the problem of Ibrahim to Madhav and sends him all the pathological reports. The reports are in French and they need to be translated into English. I accept the help of Laura from Paris. She tries her best, but the task is indeed difficult because it is translating medical transcripts without the proper understanding of medical terminology. Through video and e-mail exchanges, I learn that medical opinions are being gathered from expert practitioners in India. But the decision has to be made\u2014a decision about where the child should be operated on. In India or in Nigeria? Nigeria is a bordering country of Niger. Niger citizens don\u2019t need a visa. But there is a major problem. Nigeria is an anglophone country. Neither of the child\u2019s parents nor any close relative can speak English. Aki manages to find a gentleman who agrees to accompany Ibrahim\u2019s parents. She has gathered the courage to send the child to Nigeria. Madhav is an alchemist and also a catalyst. He has a unique ability to bring diverse forces together to turn them into positive energy. He finds a donor! Sapphira (Vijay and Marie Goradia Charitable Foundation, USA) I have never met her and have not even written to her. But when I think about her, I imagine a young girl who is empathetic about everything under the sky\u2014a pious soul. Tirelessly, she keeps in touch with Aki and they become a team. She connects with the\u00a0SightLife, a global health organization focused on eliminating corneal blindness. They help identify doctors in Nigeria, finds the best one and starts communicating with him. A seamless, absolutely grounded and genuine effort with no intention of getting any recognition\u2014I must meet Sapphira someday.  Dr. Fasina Yemi from Nigeria operates on Ibrahim Just one week ago, Aki sends the following e-mail to me: \u201cI hope you are doing fine. I just came back to Niger after several weeks travel to Japan and Ghana; then finally I saw Ibrahim yesterday. During his stay in Nigeria and when he came back home, I was not in Niger, but I could get the information from the hospital. He is fine. The operation was successfully done and he recovered very well the doctor said. Please find attached picture (unfortunately he was so nervous, he didn\u2019t smile!! So he didn\u2019t look fine\u2026but he is okay) He just has to stay at home because his nose is still fragile and must not be touched. I will try to make a video call sometime to the doctor in Nigeria to show him Ibrahim and discuss. Anyway, Ibrahim will have another consultation with the doctor at the Nigeria hospital in May, then if no problem, the treatment will be done. I hope everything is going well.\u201d Aki keeps transferring her energy. \n\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Us\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Pratham  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBoard  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLeadership  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPartners  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tPrograms\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEducation  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVocational Training   \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnnual Status of Education Report  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPratham Council For Vulnerable Children  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCovid Response  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLearning Readiness & Catch Up  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLessons from the Pandemic  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tGet Involved\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJob Opportunities  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInternships  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tDelhi Office\t\t\t\t\t\t \nB- 4/59, Safdarjung Enclave\n1st Floor, New Delhi - 110 029\nEmail: info@pratham.org\nContact number: 01141651638\n\n\t\t Mumbai Office \nY.B.

A once promising student, Dattatray was forced to drop out of school in the ninth grade to help support his family. For three years, he worked as an informal worker at a local garage, applying his drive and intelligence to cars rather than books. As his experience and understanding of automobiles grew, so did his ambition. Dattatray wanted formal employment that would allow him to better support his family. He even dreamed of one day opening his own garage. But without a high school diploma, what kind of job could he hope to get? His prospects limited, Dattatray was stuck. Then, one day, a friend told him about Pratham\u2019s vocational program in Panvel, three hours away. Not only would its automobile course allow Dattatray to polish his skills, but he would graduate with a certificate that would open up a new world of job opportunities. And Pratham\u2019s \u201clearn now, pay later\u201d option made all of this affordable. Dattatray had found a way out of his situation. Dattatray excelled in Pratham\u2019s vocational program, gradually playing a lead role in practical demonstrations. What\u2019s more, at the end of the course, he was one of the handful of students selected to receive seed money to start their own businesses. And it wasn\u2019t only his instructors who were impressed\u2014Dattatray was offered a position at the prestigious Tata Motors in Pune. Wherever his choices would take him, he was no longer stuck. \n\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Us\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Pratham  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBoard  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLeadership  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPartners  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tPrograms\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEducation  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVocational Training   \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnnual Status of Education Report  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPratham Council For Vulnerable Children  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCovid Response  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLearning Readiness & Catch Up  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLessons from the Pandemic  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tGet Involved\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJob Opportunities  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInternships  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tDelhi Office\t\t\t\t\t\t \nB- 4/59, Safdarjung Enclave\n1st Floor, New Delhi - 110 029\nEmail: info@pratham.org\nContact number: 01141651638\n\n\t\t Mumbai Office \nY.B.

His parents were landless laborers with no resources to raise him and his siblings. Seeking a chance at a better life, Sunil ran away from home to Mumbai, the city where dreams could become a reality. Instead, he found something much closer to a nightmare\u2014the hopeful migrant was put to work alongside hundreds of other poor children in an embroidery sweatshop. Forced to work up to 20 hours a day in cramped, dimly lit rooms, their only payment was food to keep them alive. In 2006, when Pratham facilitated large-scale state rescue operations, Sunil was one of the fortunate ones to be freed. He was then enrolled in Pratham\u2019s Gyanshala program, which provides education and other support to those rescued from child labor. After their basic foundational skills are established, the children attend a nearby government school while continuing to live with fellow Gyanshala students. They are also exposed to music and sports. It was here that Sunil began to excel at kabaddi, a sport in which players must cross to the other team\u2019s half, touch an opponent and escape back to their own side\u2014all on a single breath. Today, Sunil is a confident, capable young man. He is among the 35% of students to have passed the grade 12 exam, scoring in the 65th percentile. He has also won many medals representing Bihar on the kabaddi court, where, as in life, he has been to the other side and made it back safely.

His penchant for mischief was renowned, and the community\u2014including the boy\u2019s parents\u2014had given up on him. He was, as one teacher put it, \u201con the wrong track.\u201d That was before educator Surendra Kumar invited him to a Pratham exploratory science workshop. \u201cInvited\u201d may not be the right word. More like \u201chounded.\u201d There were many visits by Surendra to Sumit\u2019s house to persuade him to attend a session of the program, which is part of a collaboration between Pratham and the local government designed to stimulate scientific curiosity among middle schoolers in rural India using Pratham\u2019s philosophy of \u201clearn by doing.\u201d His persistence seemed futile until one day, Sumit just showed up at class. At first, he was his usual self\u2014refusing to sit down or talk, gazing at a model of a magnetic train rather than listening to the teacher. Then the lights in the classroom went off. A film projector came on. Sumit sat in the darkness, listening to the voice of scientist Arvind Gupta, mesmerized by images of the inventor\u2019s experimental learning toys made from everyday objects: paper caps and houses\u2026magical match sticks\u2026a dancing man\u2026 Afterwards, the children were asked to make one toy of their choosing from the movie and bring it to the next session. The following day, each child waited to be called on to present their toy. But Sumit couldn\u2019t wait. \u201cLook!\u201d he shouted, holding up a series of objects one by one, \u201cMagical matchstick! A crocodile! A house! Dancing man!\u201d Sumit had created them all. He had even replicated the train that so fascinated him the day before. Stunned, Surendra asked Sumit to demonstrate his techniques to the others, which he was happy to do. With his passion for science awakened, Sumit went on to enroll in Pratham\u2019s science camp.

I don\u2019t expect him to be a billionaire, but I want him to do well\u00a0enough to be able to take care of himself and, someday, his own family.\u201d As Shivam returns with my water, she wipes tears from her eyes. I drink and do the same. \u2014\u00a0Excerpted from field interviews by Pratham Intern Kavya \n\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Us\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Pratham  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBoard  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLeadership  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPartners  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tPrograms\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEducation  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVocational Training   \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnnual Status of Education Report  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPratham Council For Vulnerable Children  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCovid Response  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLearning Readiness & Catch Up  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLessons from the Pandemic  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tGet Involved\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJob Opportunities  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInternships  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tDelhi Office\t\t\t\t\t\t \nB- 4/59, Safdarjung Enclave\n1st Floor, New Delhi - 110 029\nEmail: info@pratham.org\nContact number: 01141651638\n\n\t\t Mumbai Office \nY.B.

A group of local children and I sit in the small but comfortable room where class is being held. I watch as Sherine engages the kids with stories, discussions and a variety of hands-on activities and am amazed at how eagerly these six- to ten-year-olds respond to her teaching. One or two are so enthusiastic that they even attempt to teach me some Urdu. (No easy task.) Soon the lesson is over and it is time to leave. But Sherine insists I first meet her parents. \u201cHow incredible,\u201d I think. \u201cShe is running the camp in her house.\u201d From her parents, I learn that not long ago, Sherine was an eighth-grade dropout whose educational journey seemed to be finished after her father\u2019s unemployment forced her to leave school. Pratham\u2019s Second Chance program, which was free and near her home, made it possible for Sherine to complete her education while also fulfilling her household obligations. They single out one teacher as being particularly inspirational: Parveen Sayyed. A former teen volunteer, Parveen is now head of the Pratham Urdu program, responsible for developing all educational material and programs in Urdu. \u201cShe made it clear to us,\u201d Sherine tells me, \u201cthat we too could do great things if we set our minds to it.\u201d Passing the secondary school exam enabled Sherine to move forward in her education\u2014and beyond expectations\u2014by enrolling in college where she studies Civics, Economics and Commerce. While this is itself an achievement, Sherine went a step further: by deciding to run Pratham\u2019s urban camps in the evening, it is now she who has become the inspiration for others.

She is headed for a job interview with a group of other girls, all hoping to find employment as electricians\u2014typically a man\u2019s field. Three months ago, Samita was living at home with her aunt, uncle and brother in Shahabaz. She had a twelfth-grade education but no clear direction in life, and she feared marriage might deter any further dreams of education. When a neighbor told her about the Pratham vocational training program in Panvel, Samita jumped at the chance. She enrolled in a three-month electrical course at PACE (Pratham Arora Center for Education), which provided her with classroom instruction and hands-on learning in a growing industry. The 18-year-old admits to a life-long interest in all things technical: studying gadgets, working with her hands, fixing appliances at home. Having the proper training now gives her a chance for a career. Samita is eager to prove herself in the male-dominated electrical field. She understands the inner workings of a light bulb. She can mend a solar street lamp. She is ready to support herself with a job, even if it means moving away from her family. Pratham\u2019s innovative \u201cplace and track\u201d network of coordinators will assist Samita in such a transition, whether it be finding her a place to live or helping her communicate with a new boss. But first, she must get the job. Samita listens intently to last-minute tips from a PACE instructor then strides out the door, eager for her interview. \n\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Us\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Pratham  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBoard  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLeadership  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPartners  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tPrograms\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEducation  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVocational Training   \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnnual Status of Education Report  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPratham Council For Vulnerable Children  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCovid Response  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLearning Readiness & Catch Up  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLessons from the Pandemic  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tGet Involved\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJob Opportunities  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInternships  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tDelhi Office\t\t\t\t\t\t \nB- 4/59, Safdarjung Enclave\n1st Floor, New Delhi - 110 029\nEmail: info@pratham.org\nContact number: 01141651638\n\n\t\t Mumbai Office \nY.B.

She gets up at 5:00 am each day to begin her household chores and finish her homework before school starts. She loves math but struggles with reading. Then, one day, she has to leave. Her father, who works as a laborer, moves his entire family to the city for several months, where they work at construction sites hoping to earn enough money to get by for the year. When the girl returns to school, she has fallen behind. This cycle repeats itself, and with each passing year, it becomes harder and harder for her to catch up. This girl is Priyanka Meena. When Pratham\u2019s Read India program came to her village\u2014in the Lalsot district of Rajasthan\u2014Priyanka was excited. She attended the learning camp held at her school every day. By focusing on Priyanka\u2019s current skill level rather than her age, Pratham was able to help her catch up. Testing showed drastic improvement from the start to the end of the 40-day camp. The hands-on activities added a new level of enjoyment. Priyanka\u2019s\u00a0penchant for math increased, and she even developed an interest in reading. Even though the camp has ended, Priyanka\u2019s rekindled enthusiasm for learning has not. In her precious free time between chores and school, Priyanka devours the books and worksheets Pratham staff have left for the students. Now, Priyanka can\u2019t wait to return to the city\u2014but not as a construction worker.

Both were studying to pass their tenth-grade exam, Kabita after an absence from school of over two decades. Despite their age difference, they shared a special bond: Kabita was Lili\u2019s mother. Then, unexpectedly, Kabita\u2019s husband\u2014Lili\u2019s father\u2014passed away. The two were forced to abandon their studies yet again. Kabita worked extra hours as an ASHA health worker to support the family. Lili took over the duties of housework. When Abhimanyu, a Pratham organizer, visited them to pay his respects, he found them despondent. But with his encouragement, they decided to re-enroll in the Second Chance program the following year and earn their secondary school diplomas. It wouldn\u2019t be easy, but Pratham had rekindled their determination. If Kabita couldn\u2019t attend class because of work, Lili taught her at home from her notes. When things became too hard and Lili wanted to give up, her mother\u2019s words gave her strength: This spring, against many odds, mother and daughter passed their tenth-grade exams.

He lives in Bharukhera village in Haryana\u2019s Sirsa district, with his parents, grandmother, and a younger sister. Chirag has faced speech difficulties since his childhood, struggling with communicating. His father, a farmer, faced financial constraints that limited his ability to provide quality care and medical support to Chirag. In 2022, when Chirag was five, Pratham\u2019s team members met him at the Anganwadi centre in his village.\u00a0 Chirag's story took a turning point with the intervention of Pratham's ECE (Early Childhood Education) program. Through a carefully crafted curriculum, emphasizing on physical, cognitive, social, emotional, language, and math development, the program engaged with Chirag in a way that was never done before. Activities like paper folding, ball games, and colouring, and engaging conversations with friends along with joyful rhymes, played a pivotal role in boosting Chirag's confidence. At first, Chirag was hesitant, but he gradually began participating and enjoying the activities like counting and jumping exercises. His favourite rhyme, 'Ek Mota Hathi' became a symbol of his progress. He showed remarkable progress with continuous support from the Anganwadi teacher and Pratham's team members. He began to actively engage with his friends, sing songs, and gained competence in counting and reading. The impact extended beyond Chirag's learning levels. His new found confidence and determination made him speak about his ambition as he shared, \u201cI will become a police officer when I grow up and protect my village from thieves.\u201d\u00a0 Chirag's parents, once concerned about their son's future, now joyfully embraced Pratham\u2019s activities as part of their daily routine.\u00a0 Chirag's story serves as an inspiration, reminding us all that with the right support and guidance, every child can overcome obstacles and strive for a brighter future. \n\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Us\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Pratham  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBoard  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLeadership  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPartners  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tPrograms\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEducation  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVocational Training   \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnnual Status of Education Report  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPratham Council For Vulnerable Children  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCovid Response  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLearning Readiness & Catch Up  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLessons from the Pandemic  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tGet Involved\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJob Opportunities  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInternships  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tDelhi Office\t\t\t\t\t\t \nB- 4/59, Safdarjung Enclave\n1st Floor, New Delhi - 110 029\nEmail: info@pratham.org\nContact number: 01141651638\n\n\t\t Mumbai Office \nY.B.

The objective was to train youth (18\u201025 years) from economically disadvantaged backgrounds and provide them with employable skills, coupled with access to employment and entrepreneurship opportunities. Today, Pratham\u2019s Skilling programs are spread across the country to enable youth to access entry-level jobs in 10 major vocations. Pratham\u2019s affiliations include the National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) and multiple Sector Skill Councils. In 2020, Pratham re-designed its training models to incorporate digital resources and launched the Hybrid Skilling program, with the primary focus of helping youth find employment in the post-pandemic world. India has one of the youngest and largest workforce in the world, with 250 million youth expected to enter the working population over the next 10 years. However, less than 5% of India\u2019s workforce is formally skilled and over 80% of the labour force is engaged in the informal economy. There is a significant gap between the aspirations and abilities of youth. Training youth in vocational courses and entrepreneurship which are aligned with industry demands will help to ensure that the enormous gap between youth aspirations and abilities begins to close.\u00a0 Pratham runs more than 140 centres across 18 states and 1 Union Territory in India with a placement rate of over 85 percent. Over the past 10 years, Pratham\u2019s Vocational Training programs have helped more than 200,000 youth across the country access industry-specific training and placement opportunities, through a network of over 2,000 employers. In 2022-23, more than 30,000 youth were trained.

LEVEL 3 Practical skills training to be completed either at a Pratham training centre, industry partner, or a community-based centre. Duration of 30-45 days. In addition to industry-specific skills, students are also offered basic English, computer literacy and life skills.

Her early years were marked by financial hardship which prevented her from getting a formal education. Born into a family of daily wage labourers, she was the middle child among two brothers and three sisters. Bisro never went to school or got access to education until she was 16. At the age of 16, an opportunity emerged like a beacon of hope \u2013 a free Ratri Shala \u2013 a night school, an initiative by the people in her village. She seized the opportunity and enrolled herself at the Grade 5 level, but due to unforeseen circumstances, the school closed down, leaving her without a passing certificate. Bisro got married at the age of 18 and soon became a mother. Amid household and childcare responsibilities, her dreams of education were put on hold. She came to know of the \u2018Samtulyata Pariksha\u2019 program, a part of Sakshar Bharat, an initiative of the state government. This program offered another chance to pursue her studies, this time at Grade 8 in the local government school. But as her family grew, household responsibilities took precedence, and after completing Grade 8, she had to discontinue her education once again. After a gap of 15 years, at the age of 48, in 2023, Bisro was led to Pratham\u2019s Second Chance program, which was a turning point in her life. The Second Chance program is designed to help women and girls, who couldn\u2019t finish school, to complete their Grade 10 exams, in the hope that this academic certificate would further their opportunities for educational growth and employability. With the unwavering support of her family, Bisro embarked on this journey, which required her to cross a river to attend classes at the Second Chance centre. Despite facing taunts and societal judgements that questioned her decision to return to school at the age of 48, she remained resolute. After completing Grade 10, she now aspires to continue her education through an open board. She believes, \u201cLearning and education are not limited by age, and one should always seize the opportunity to learn.\u201d Bisro currently works as a government health worker in her village, known as a Mitanin. She took this job to support her family while effectively balancing her studies and job responsibilities. Bisro was driven from the very beginning. She felt the need of education every time she went to the bank or boarded the bus and wanted to read and understand herself, instead of seeking help from others. Her story is a testament to the idea that education knows no age limit and the boundless potential that resides within us. \n\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Us\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Pratham  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBoard  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLeadership  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPartners  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tPrograms\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEducation  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVocational Training   \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnnual Status of Education Report  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPratham Council For Vulnerable Children  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCovid Response  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLearning Readiness & Catch Up  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLessons from the Pandemic  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tGet Involved\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJob Opportunities  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInternships  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tDelhi Office\t\t\t\t\t\t \nB- 4/59, Safdarjung Enclave\n1st Floor, New Delhi - 110 029\nEmail: info@pratham.org\nContact number: 01141651638\n\n\t\t Mumbai Office \nY.B.

Two years ago, their father passed away from a heart attack. Their mother, Manjulata, who worked as a domestic help, became the sole breadwinner of the family. Burdened with familial and financial responsibilities, Manjulata constantly worried about Jaga and Balia\u2019s future. Despite the daily travails, Manjulata firmly believed that the education of her children will uplift them from their miseries. She was confident that if her children studied, they would be able to secure jobs with good income. The constraints of their financial situation did dampen her aspirations until the day she discovered Pratham\u2019s \u201cfree\u201d CAMaL Ka Camp, as Manjulata likes to describe it. The CAMaL Ka Camp is a summer camp by Pratham that aims to bridge learning gaps and help children, transitioning from primary to middle school, catch-up on literacy and numeracy skills. With renewed optimism, Manjulata enrolled Jaga and Balia in the summer camp. An initial assessment at the beginning of the camp revealed that Jaga and Balia were struggling to read the most basic of sentences and solve simple division questions. Under the guidance of Pratham\u2019s volunteers, the two boys embarked on a fun learning journey. Every day, they participated in warm-up games like \u201cFire in the Mountain.\" They loved the story activities too, where they could listen and discuss stories with friends. These engaging and simple learning activities sparked a love for learning in Jaga and Balia. As days passed, Jaga and Balia\u2019s confidence bloomed. Within a few weeks, they went from struggling with reading comprehension to reading stories fluently. Even the once-daunting division problems became easy for them to solve. Manjulata didn\u2019t just stand on the sidelines; she was actively involved in the camp, just like her children. She attended classes to learn the camp\u2019s teaching methods. She learnt how to use household objects to teach children at home. The camp made her realize that as a mother she plays a critical role in her sons\u2019 learning journey. \u201cI used to think that I was not capable of supporting my children\u2019s education since I wasn\u2019t educated myself. But Pratham\u2019s summer camp gave me the confidence that I could also make a huge difference in their learning journey. Through the summer camp, I learned how to teach my children basic concepts using simple tools and life experiences,\" Manjulata said. \n\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Us\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Pratham  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBoard  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLeadership  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPartners  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tPrograms\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEducation  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVocational Training   \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnnual Status of Education Report  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPratham Council For Vulnerable Children  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCovid Response  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLearning Readiness & Catch Up  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLessons from the Pandemic  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tGet Involved\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJob Opportunities  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInternships  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tDelhi Office\t\t\t\t\t\t \nB- 4/59, Safdarjung Enclave\n1st Floor, New Delhi - 110 029\nEmail: info@pratham.org\nContact number: 01141651638\n\n\t\t Mumbai Office \nY.B.

Hailing from a small village called Binodpur in West Bengal, she faced economic hardships that forced her to discontinue her education. Her family's financial struggles, with her father working as a farmer and her brothers dropping out of school, made things even harder. But Chintamoni's passion for learning never wavered. She grabbed every opportunity that came her way. In 2022, Chintamoni's life took a significant turn when she became a volunteer teacher at Pratham's CAMaL Ka Camp, a summer catch-up camp supporting children in Grades IV and V to improve their literacy and numeracy skills. She taught children reading, writing, math through guided activities encouraging children to participate and communicate effectively. She got an opportunity to enhance her skills as well. Under Pratham's 'Education For Education' (EFE) initiative, Chintamoni did a Digital Readiness course focusing on digital literacy. In 2023, when the summer camp returned to the village, she once again signed up as a volunteer. This time, Chintamoni went door to door encouraging families to let their children attend the CAMaL Ka Camp. With her determination and persistence, she inspired the local youth to join as volunteers. Having conducted the previous year's camp with great success, she was very confident to pull off all the reading, writing, math activities with ease. Moreover, she looked forward to teaching and interacting with children. This year Chintamoni did Pratham's \u2018Be Internet Awesome\u2019 course. Through the course, she understood more about sharing personal information with care, identifying fraud calls and links, cyberbullying and cyber crime. \u201cI am very happy to get this opportunity to learn about so many useful things through EFE.

When the CAMaL Ka Camp was starting during the summer break, the Pratham team had asked Ragini to join as a volunteer. CAMaL Ka Camp is a summer catch-up camp, supporting children in Grade 4, 5, and 6 to brush up on language and basic math skills before entering middle school. She wasn\u2019t convinced initially that the children needed to improve their learning skills. She, however, changed her mind when she saw that some of the children were unable to read from a Hindi textbook. She decided to support Pratham. After going through the intensive training given to volunteers, Ragini began the camp by reading out stories to children and engaging them. She incorporated a myriad of activities, from singing playful songs to engaging games to solving puzzles, to make learning enjoyable and interactive. However, during her teaching session, she encountered an obstacle: There wasn't a blackboard available to facilitate her teaching. Rather than letting this roadblock hinder her plans, she found a smart solution. After scrounging through her house, she spotted an old iron door sitting forgotten. It may not seem like the typical classroom fixture, yet she saw its potential serving as a blackboard. Discarded fertilizer containers offered the perfect elevation for her makeshift creation. \u201cYou don't need resources, but an intent to bring about change. Children unexpectedly turn up and refuse to leave even after the camp is over. This is the kamaal (amazing) aspect of CAMaL Ka Camp,\" she said. Under Ragini's guidance, the children in her village made remarkable progress in just a few weeks. They could read, solve math problems, and narrate stories. Ragini's friends joined to help manage the growing crowd, and the children saw her as an elder sister, not just a teacher. Ragini's story shows how one person can make a huge impact, even with seemingly small efforts. Small creative improvisations can bring about significant and meaningful change. \n\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Us\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Pratham  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBoard  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLeadership  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPartners  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tPrograms\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEducation  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVocational Training   \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnnual Status of Education Report  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPratham Council For Vulnerable Children  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCovid Response  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLearning Readiness & Catch Up  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLessons from the Pandemic  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tGet Involved\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJob Opportunities  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInternships  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tDelhi Office\t\t\t\t\t\t \nB- 4/59, Safdarjung Enclave\n1st Floor, New Delhi - 110 029\nEmail: info@pratham.org\nContact number: 01141651638\n\n\t\t Mumbai Office \nY.B.

The primary source of income in the village is farming and daily wage labour, with some even working as cobblers and in kilns. Many villagers hold the belief that their children cannot keep pace with the rapidly advancing society and will eventually be limited to agricultural activities. Bulti has been associated with Pratham since 2016. She has a daughter named Trisha, studying in Grade 3, and a son named Subhajit, attending Anganwadi (pre-school). Bulti was determined to support her own children and other youngsters in the community with their learning. Being the only woman in the village who had completed secondary education, Bulti had once aspired to study further and secure a job. Early marriage and household responsibilities put a hold on her dreams. She nurtured a strong desire to provide her children with a good education and support their learning journey. When she was introduced to Pratham and its educational initiatives for children, she was thrilled to find new ways to support the children in her community. When schools closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Bulti assisted the children in her neighborhood with their learning, utilizing the support provided by Pratham through phone calls and messages. Her dedication and commitment inspired other mothers to play an active role in supporting their children\u2019s education at home. During the lockdown, Pratham engaged directly with families of young children (preschool age and those who were of Grade 1 and 2 age). They were sent activities to do with their children via SMS and WhatsApp. Follow-ups were done via phone calls. Young mothers were encouraged to form their own mother-child groups in the neighbourhood and get together regularly to do activities with their children. Bulti played a pivotal role in creating a mother\u2019s group in the village. As the leader of this group, she reads and comprehends all the teaching-learning materials and messages from Pratham, subsequently sharing and demonstrating this knowledge with the other mothers. Bulti also extends her support to these mothers, assisting them in conducting educational activities with their children. Amidst her daily household chores, Bulti prioritizes taking out time for her children\u2019s education and educating other mothers to raise awareness. She strongly believes, \u201cEducation is the only tool that can help us keep up with the present time, and if we work together, our community will not be left behind.\u201d \n\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Us\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Pratham  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBoard  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLeadership  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPartners  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tPrograms\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEducation  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVocational Training   \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnnual Status of Education Report  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPratham Council For Vulnerable Children  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCovid Response  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLearning Readiness & Catch Up  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLessons from the Pandemic  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tGet Involved\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJob Opportunities  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInternships  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tDelhi Office\t\t\t\t\t\t \nB- 4/59, Safdarjung Enclave\n1st Floor, New Delhi - 110 029\nEmail: info@pratham.org\nContact number: 01141651638\n\n\t\t Mumbai Office \nY.B.

She is fond of children and loves to tell stories and conduct activities with them. She has been associated with Pratham since the pandemic years, and has been instrumental in keeping the children motivated and engaged during the pandemic. Kanaklata\u2019s relative Pragya is a part of Pratham\u2019s learning camp and mothers\u2019 group activities. Kanaklata helps to conduct the activities, and the children love her company. They fondly call her \u2018Kanaklata Aaita\u2019 (grandmother). Kanaklata is a storehouse of fun-learning activities and rhymes. She learned these activities when she was a child, and she also visits the village Anganwadi to learn new ones. She is always looking for new ways to engage the children, and is willing to share her knowledge with others. Kanaklata\u2019s unique way of conducting activities and rhymes has been greatly appreciated by children and their mothers. She was recently requested by other village mothers to teach them rhymes and activities as their children love them. \u201cThe way she tells us a story, we feel that we are inside the story,\u201d says one of the children, who love her way of storytelling.

There are fewer secondary schools to choose from, so students who have fallen behind, do not have a school nearby, or cannot afford to further their education often drop out. Other social pressures, such as marriage, play a significant role in dropout rates, too. Second Chance consists of a four-month Foundation Course, which covers studies like English, Mathematics, Language, Science and Life Skills. After that, students progress to the Main Course, where they prepare for the Board examination, the final step toward their the Grade 10 certificate. Development and enrichment activities are also organised, to impart health, childcare, technology and additional education Since its inception in 2011, over 27,000 girls have benefited from Pratham's Second Chance program across nine states in India. 17,134 students have appeared for the Board examinations, and 75% of students from the program pass.

We look to fill in the gaps and improve the quality of education provided to Indian children in primary and middle schools. Our learning camps are based on cooperative learning and community. In addition, we engage parents, teachers, volunteers and local governments to ensure children aren\u2019t just sitting at their school desks each day, but are actually learning. We group children based on abilities, not age. In contrast to the traditional approach in India\u2019s classrooms, proficiency-based grouping allows us to ensure every child knows the fundamentals before advancing. Our activity-based learning method incorporates speaking, listening, reading, writing and plenty of encouragement. Our classrooms and camps are held during school hours, led by teachers and trained community volunteers. Whereas India\u2019s schools lack learning goals and testing, our programs use regular monitoring and assessment. Pratham\u2019s \u201cTeaching at the Right Level\u201d (TaRL) strategy has been evaluated by the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab, through randomised control trials six times in the last ten years.  Our learning interventions have shown a 50% increase in children\u2019s reading levels and a 45% increase in their ability to recognise two- and three-digit numbers after 100 hours of instruction. Of the 346,000 children who participated in Pratham learning camps during the 2015-2016 school year, the percentage who could read increased from 19% to 79%. We want to increase our reach, sustainably. Pratham has developed a vast network of local volunteers and resources across India to integrate our methods both inside and outside the classroom. Our programs are low-cost and easily replicable, which, along with our extensive teacher training, has helped us expand into 24 cities and 21 of India's 29 states. In addition, we work with governments to test programs, as well as create and monitor standards to each region\u2019s specific needs.

The odds are stacked against young women in India. An estimated 4 million Indian girls are out of school. Of those who attend primary school, 80% drop out before reaching Grade 8. In addition, India is home to one-third of the world\u2019s child brides. Whether it\u2019s cultural barriers, socio-economic obstacles or a matter of familial circumstances that have motivated girls to drop out, the Pratham Second Chance program awaits with open arms. Our year-long program begins with a four-month course in math, language, science, and English to reinforce essential elementary school concepts. Students who perform well advance to the second part of the program, which includes subject-specific tutoring in a supportive network of learning centres that prepares them for the Secondary School examination. Our model allows girls to attend classes at learning sites in or near their villages in the afternoon, once their chores are complete. Students attend classes five days out of the month for intensive learning from subject specialists. In between sessions, tutors guide students through the course material and address any knowledge gaps. Families are not expected to pay the program fees, which makes the program feasible for many more girls to attend. Since 2011, the program has seen tremendous gains: including a 50% increase in the number of dropouts re-engaged in learning and a 30% increase in participant graduation rates. We\u2019ve also tripled our number of centres, so we now have 32 centres connected to 200 learning sites across nine states The high graduation rates achieved by Pratham students prove that a little effort can make a real impact in educating girls in underserved communities. $500 enrols one student in the 12-month program to complete her secondary school education \"Our vision is to end the cycle of poverty in India by providing access to education.

Its model, known as Teaching at the Right Level (tarl), uses speedy oral tests to sort children in their last years of primary school into groups that match their learning levels, rather than their age. These groups commonly gather for one hour of each school day to practise either maths or reading. Alternatively children may attend intensive catch-up \u201ccamps\u201d, which are repeated throughout the school year.

Instead, he found something much closer to a nightmare\u2014the hopeful migrant was put to work alongside hundreds of other poor children in an embroidery sweatshop. Forced to work up to 20 hours a day in cramped, dimly lit rooms, their only payment was food to keep them alive. In 2006, when Pratham facilitated large-scale state rescue operations, Sunil was one of the fortunate ones to be freed. He was then enrolled in Pratham\u2019s Gyanshala program, which provides education and other support to those rescued from child labor. After their basic foundational skills are established, the children attend a nearby government school while continuing to live with fellow Gyanshala students.

A group of local children and I sit in the small but comfortable room where class is being held. I watch as Sherine engages the kids with stories, discussions and a variety of hands-on activities and am amazed at how eagerly these six- to ten-year-olds respond to her teaching.

Download the full interview transcript: https://www.hbs.edu/creating-emerging-markets/Documents/transcripts/Chavan-Banerji_Final-Transcript%20for%20Web.pdf Interview Summary Chavan and Banerji begin the interview by reflecting on their educations and early careers prior to Pratham. Both moved to the United States for graduate studies, obtaining PhD degrees in Chemistry and Education respectively. When Chavan returned to India in 1986, he intended to become a chemistry teacher. However, he was drawn to an adult literacy program started by the Indian Prime Minister at the time, Rajiv Gandhi. The adult literacy program later began to dissipate after 1991 following India's shift towards liberalization. In 1992-93, the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) began focusing on primary education with the goal of bringing business, government and the voluntary sectors together in order to understand and solve problems with the education system in India. It was in this context that Chavan co-founded Pratham in Mumbai, with the goal of implementing a new model and approach to the situation. Banerji joined Pratham in 1996, while it was starting to expand by opening hundreds and then thousands of preschool centers around Mumbai. During her first years with Pratham, Banerji conducted a study to assess the math skills of 3rd and 4th grade students. The simple assessment evolved into ASER, the Annual Status of Education Report \u2013 an academic report that is widely used in India as well as other countries. She emphasizes the need to develop easily replicable educational tools and assessments that can stimulate policy action and change. As India continued to develop rapidly in the 2000s, Chavan explains that the need to address gaps in the education system became increasingly clear, particularly to businesses which started establishing foundations dedicated to supporting education. As an organization, Pratham held a unique position as it worked alongside both government and businesses. They built partnerships with government at different levels, and Chavan emphasizes how that was important given that there is \u201cno single thing called government.\u201d He relates that working with different layers of government was comparable to \u201cplaying the whole court.\u201d Banerji and Chavan proceed by laying out the challenges that persist in India\u2019s education sector, especially following the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and the expansion of remote learning technologies. They discuss a need to look at education as a whole from a different perspective, utilizing technology to break down barriers to learning. This includes promoting the use of PraDigi, a digital initiative that provides tablets equipped with a learning app delivering high-quality, interactive educational content. Chavan underscores the importance of utilizing such technology to foster an easily accessible and open learning environment. To conclude the interview, Banerji and Chavan address the question of leadership succession, as Banerji became Pratham\u2019s Chief Executive Officer in 2015 after Chavan. While Chavan remains involved, he articulates advice for leaders who should \u201cget out of the way of the next person,\u201d preparing the organization and relationships within it for a new leadership style. While describing themselves as different when it comes to their approach, both Banerji and Chavan express a persistent commitment to expanding the organization\u2019s mission further, by having \u201cevery child in school and learning well.\u201d This article was originally published by Harvard Business School.

You can read the full article here: \u2018The school of my dreams\u2019 It is a bright sunny Thursday morning \u2014 August 15, 2047. The school compound is packed with children and adults, current students, families and friends. There are also many others, those who have been part of this school community in past decades. On each side of the open courtyard is a big screen. People who are not here in person can link virtually to watch, participate and interact. Like always, right in the centre of the compound, on a tall pole, is the tricolour waiting to be hoisted and unfurled. From the outside, the school building does not look different from before. But inside, it is very different. No longer can you see desks and benches in rows facing the blackboard. Now there are rooms with open space where teachers and children can organise themselves in whatever way they want. Grades have given way to stages. Libraries now have devices and tool kits that can be borrowed to take home. Laboratories are open for even young children to experiment and tinker. A group of middle-aged women are on the stage. Twenty-five years ago, they had worked closely together. In the centre is the Standard I teacher from 2022 and her friend, the anganwadi instructor from that time. Around them are mothers, whose children were either in anganwadi or in the early grades more than two dozen years ago. From a distance, this group looks like a tight bunch of colourful flowers. The women speak of a time, when a fearsome pandemic had shut schools for two years. Those were bad years. When the schools opened, everyone agreed that it was essential for young children to have strong foundations for future learning. Standard I and II teachers joined hands with the nearby anganwadi instructors and began to build this pathway. Mothers joined the effort, families engaged in fun learning activities with children at home and small groups of mothers met every week in their neighbourhood to discuss what more they could do together to strengthen their children\u2019s learning, growth and development. Since then, the village has not looked back. The path from anganwadi to school has become smoother and stronger over time. For many years now, little children enrol in first grade, confident and ready. One of the mothers invited her daughter on to the stage. The tall young lady who ran up the steps was in Standard I in 2022. Today in her early thirties, she is a surgeon in a nearby hospital. With gratitude, she embraced the women standing around her, for placing her on the road to success. Next in line are children from the middle school stage. Their excitement is palpable even to those far away. The screens in the school yard are now showing a film made by these children. It is about water in the village. In middle school nowadays, groups of students work together, to identify a problem in the community, understand it and work towards a solution. Moving well beyond the confines of the textbook, using real life situations to learn, is now the norm. Over the years, rainfall had become erratic and uncertain. Middle school children had been tracking changes over time. They are currently working with adults to develop water storage solutions that could help everyone in the dry months. Older students had been patiently waiting their turn. Once on stage, they speak of their time in high school. One student laughs, as she recounts how difficult her father\u2019s life had been; his entire time in high school was dominated by exams and his life afterwards dependent solely on his exam result. Luckily, this does not happen anymore. The young girl explains \u2014 she can take any exam online anytime, whenever she feels ready. \u201cWe use ATM\u201d she says proudly, \u201cthe Anytime Testing Machine\u201d. She smiles some more. \u201cMy father is jealous that exams are not high stakes any more. Today, there are so many ways to move ahead.\u201d For example, she and a few friends had been experimenting with small business ideas. The school provided a bit of seed funding and a lot of encouragement and guidance. From the stage, she invited people of the village to look at their AI-generated movies based on stories of individual clients. It was now time to raise the flag. Fluttering in the breeze, the tricolour looked down proudly on the school below. Let us close our eyes and imagine. Every child must be able to explore her interests and to discover her own potential. Keeping all children in mind, schools, families and communities must ensure building strong foundations, developing choices for pathways and opportunities for learning. We need to work systematically and persistently, building on what has worked each year, learning from what did not, experimenting with what is needed but perhaps still just out of reach, navigating around obstacles and tracking progress. The school has to be the anchor of community life, leveraging the past, building the present and planning for a better future. If our heads, hearts and hands come together, it is possible that every school on August 15, 2047 will be celebrating like the one we are reading about now.

This means that ASER provides a comprehensive and up-to-date picture of the state of education in rural India. This information is essential for policymakers and educators who are working to improve the quality of education in India. Dr. Rukmini Banerji, CEO of Pratham Education Foundation, talks about how ASER has become more than just a data collection. It has become an experience that connects every Indian to their homeland. This is because ASER is a bottom-up 'social movement' that involves the participation of thousands of volunteers from all over India. ASER has helped to raise awareness about the importance of education and to create a sense of shared responsibility for improving the quality of education in India. In the podcast, Decoding Impact by Sattva Knowledge Institute, Dr. Banerji, ex-director of ASER Centre, discusses the success of ASER and how it all started.

Over the last 27 years, Pratham has grown to be one of the largest non-profit organizations working to provide quality education to children and youth in over 20 states and union territories across the country, through a range of interventions.\u00a0 Pratham is a widely recognized organization, having received notable awards such as the Yidan Prize, Lui Che Woo Prize, WISE Prize for Innovation, Skoll Award for Social Entrepreneurship, the Henry R Kravis Prize in Leadership, and the CNN-IBN Indian of the Year for Public Service. For more details, refer to www.pratham.org.  About the ENABLE Program The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 emphasizes the fundamental importance of universal foundational literacy and numeracy (FLN). The policy asserts that all other aspects are relevant only if children acquire these essential skills during primary school. Children, especially those with special needs and disabilities, face significant barriers hindering their acquisition of foundational skills. In India, an estimated 7.8 million children and young individuals had disabilities in 2019. Alarmingly, a large proportion of them do not attend educational institutions, and 45% struggle to attain foundational literacy. Urgent, concerted efforts and inclusive education initiatives are vital to help these children overcome obstacles, fostering their full potential. Fortunately, existing policy frameworks, technological advancements, and governmental commitment offer a unique opportunity to address this pressing need. ENABLE\u2019 or \u2018Equity in Accessing Numeracy And Basic Literacy Education\u2019, is a multi-pronged intervention to strengthen the quality of education for 3-9 year olds with disabilities.  Position Summary In the last couple of years, Pratham has reached more than 20 million children across 22 states and UTs through wide ranging education-focused programs. The Measurement, Monitoring and Evaluation Team (MME), established in 2013, has played an integral role in ensuring that Pratham, its partners in the community and government have analytically and effectively acted upon using data generated from these programs. During unprecedented school closures in the past year, the team swiftly innovated its approach to collect data remotely, thereby continuing to inform program strategy, content, and implementation decisions. The MME team has built and sustained a culture of data-backed decision making within Pratham and its partners. The central team works closely with ~60 state MME associates to ensure rigorous and timely implementation of data systems and processes in the field. While constantly strengthening, streamlining measurement at Pratham, the next major goal for the team is to extend its know-how to other non-profits, social enterprises, government data teams, and CSR functions to bring out maximum value from the data they generate. We are a young, competitive team from diverse professional organizations ranging from a top Market Research Company, a Software Giant, Analytics at a Global Fast-Food giant to a leading EdTech Company and Business Consulting firm.

She lives with her father, Raju, a farmer; her mother, a homemaker; and her younger sister, Gudiya, who is in Grade 3. With another sibling on the way, her mother was not in the best of health and relied heavily on Aarti for household chores, often causing her to miss school. When Pratham\u2019s thirty days learning camp started in October 2023 at Aarti\u2019s school, her attendance was sporadic. The school teacher confirmed her frequent absences, raising concerns about her academic progress. A Pratham team member visited Aarti\u2019s home and discovered that her absences were due to her need to help with household responsibilities, especially as her mother was expecting another child and was not well. During the home visit, the Pratham team member assessed Aarti's learning level in front of her parents. It became evident that Aarti struggled with reading and basic math. Her parents were initially skeptical about the value of regular school attendance, believing she wasn\u2019t learning much anyway. However, after learning about Pratham\u2019s engaging and effective methodologies, they were persuaded to send Aarti to school daily. Aarti began attending the learning camp, a short, intensive teaching-learning initiative conducted by Pratham staff with support from the school and community to help children catch up and improve their learning levels. Children are grouped by learning ability rather than grade, using tailored methods and materials for rapid, impactful progress. Aarti became engaged with the interactive and enjoyable learning activities in the camp. She particularly enjoyed listening to stories and participating in warm-up exercises, which sparked her interest in learning. Despite her initial enthusiasm, Aarti's mother once again started keeping her at home to help with chores. Another visit by a Pratham team member highlighted Aarti's noticeable progress \u2014 she was starting to read, albeit with some difficulty. Witnessing her daughter's improvement, Aarti's mother was convinced to allow her to attend the camp daily. With Pratham's support, Aarti progressed remarkably. She started managing her household responsibilities in the morning, ensuring support to her mother before attending the learning camp. Her confidence soared as her reading and math skills improved. By the end of the camp, Aarti could read stories and solve basic addition problems. She even joined the community children\u2019s club, where she participated in daily learning activities. Aarti's happiness was palpable as she shared her newfound skills. She took pride in being able to read and understand her lessons and was excited to share stories with her younger sister and her newborn brother. Her mother expressed her gratitude, saying, \u201cWe used to think there was no point in sending her to school if she couldn\u2019t read or understand what was being taught, but now we have realised that regular attendance at school can help. The learning camp has taught her to read.\u201d Aarti's journey is a testament to the impact of Pratham\u2019s learning camps. Her story highlights the importance of regular attendance and the right learning support. \n\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Us\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Pratham  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBoard  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLeadership  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPartners  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tPrograms\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEducation  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVocational Training   \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnnual Status of Education Report  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPratham Council For Vulnerable Children  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCovid Response  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLearning Readiness & Catch Up  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLessons from the Pandemic  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tGet Involved\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJob Opportunities  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInternships  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tDelhi Office\t\t\t\t\t\t \nB- 4/59, Safdarjung Enclave\n1st Floor, New Delhi - 110 029\nEmail: info@pratham.org\nContact number: 01141651638\n\n\t\t Mumbai Office \nY.B.

A Grade 6 student, she lives with her elder siblings. Her brother Shikari (19) and her sister Anjali (16) had to drop out of school due to the family\u2019s financial condition. Her father, Jeetu Mahato, is a single parent and works as a daily wage labourer in another state. It is her siblings who take care of Saraswati at home. Saraswati harbours dreams of becoming a doctor, however, the environment at home is not conducive to encourage learning. She frequently missed school to help her sister with household chores. In August 2023, Saraswati\u2019s school teacher, along with some Pratham officials became concerned about her learning struggles during a baseline assessment that was conducted for students in her class. At Grade 6,\u00a0 Saraswati could only identify letters, instead of reading and comprehending stories, and recognise numbers from zero to nine in Math. The baseline assessment (a pre-test to understand children\u2019s current learning levels) was done as part of the BASIC (Baseline Advancement of Students for Improved Capacity) initiative by the district administration of the Khunti district, Jharkhand with support from Pratham. This initiative runs across 54 schools in Jharkhand\u2019s Khunti district and aims to assess the learning levels of Grade 6 to 8 students and support them in their learning journey. In order to address Saraswati\u2019s learning needs, her teacher along with Pratham officials met the teenager\u2019s father at home and discussed the challenges she was facing. Saraswati\u2019s father, in turn, admitted that they were not able to support her in studies at home. Saraswati\u2019s teacher and Pratham representatives also formed a children\u2019s group in the village and made her the leader of the group. The children in this group were given daily learning worksheets to complete. Sarawati\u2019s sister Anjali became a volunteer and started supporting children with their learning. Apart from building basic arithmetic and reading skills, Saraswati was involved in group activities that covered the topics of health, hygiene, types of waste and how to recycle them. These activities boosted her confidence and instilled in her curiosity to learn more. At school too, Saraswati did various fun learning activities to improve her reading, writing and arithmetic skills as part of the BASIC classes that were held along with her regular classes. Over time, her fear of learning diminished and Saraswati began taking a keen interest in studies. She also completed the worksheets along with other children in the neighbourhood after coming home from school. When the endline assessment (a post-test to understand the learning improvements) was done in December 2023, Saraswati was able to read stories and perform simple Math operations. When Anjali (Saraswati\u2019s sister and volunteer) was asked about her thoughts on Saraswati\u2019s learning improvements, she said, \u201cWe could not continue our education due to financial constraints, but we will make sure that Saraswati does not drop out of school. Seeing her passion for learning, we will provide her with all possible support.\u201d Today, Saraswati is confident that she will bring her dream of becoming a doctor to fruition. \n\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Us\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Pratham  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBoard  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLeadership  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPartners  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tPrograms\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEducation  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVocational Training   \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnnual Status of Education Report  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPratham Council For Vulnerable Children  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCovid Response  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLearning Readiness & Catch Up  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLessons from the Pandemic  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tGet Involved\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJob Opportunities  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInternships  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tDelhi Office\t\t\t\t\t\t \nB- 4/59, Safdarjung Enclave\n1st Floor, New Delhi - 110 029\nEmail: info@pratham.org\nContact number: 01141651638\n\n\t\t Mumbai Office \nY.B.

The Pratham team then took a two-pronged approach \u2014 involving Pawan\u2019s parents in his learning journey and finding ways to support his studies. \u00a0 Pawan was enrolled into a learning camp conducted by Pratham for Grade 3-5 students from November to December, 2023. Children at the camp were grouped according to their learning levels rather than grades and within these groups, targeted teaching-learning activities were conducted. Over the days, Pawan\u2019s interest in studies grew. During the language classes, learning activities such as mind-mapping, word games etc were done at the camp. Similarly, during the Math classes, activities like number chart, tilli (sticks)-bundle game, and others were conducted. Realising the importance of his mother\u2019s involvement in Pawan\u2019s studies, the Pratham team also convinced Pawan\u2019s mother to be part of a Mothers\u2019 Group in the community. As part of the group, she was taught various learning activities to do with her children at home. She soon began supporting Pawan with reading and basic Mathematics operations at home. She also helped him understand classification by colours, encouraged him to learn poetry, storytelling, and sentence formation, etc. Pawan started doing worksheets at home with his mother\u2019s support. Meanwhile, the Pratham team made multiple visits to Pawan\u2019s home and his siblings also began supporting him in studies. With a conducive learning environment, Pawan\u2019s confidence slowly grew and his attendance improved significantly. He also excelled in group activities and completed his daily homework. Today, Pawan is able to read stories, do subtraction, and solve word problems. He has also been promoted to Grade 4 this year and goes to school regularly. Pawan\u2019s story showcases how, with the right support at home and school, one can find courage and take big leaps in learning. \n\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Us\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Pratham  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBoard  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLeadership  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPartners  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tPrograms\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEducation  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVocational Training   \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnnual Status of Education Report  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPratham Council For Vulnerable Children  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCovid Response  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLearning Readiness & Catch Up  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLessons from the Pandemic  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tGet Involved\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJob Opportunities  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInternships  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tDelhi Office\t\t\t\t\t\t \nB- 4/59, Safdarjung Enclave\n1st Floor, New Delhi - 110 029\nEmail: info@pratham.org\nContact number: 01141651638\n\n\t\t Mumbai Office \nY.B.

Sanvi\u2019s father\u2019s meagre income covers all financial responsibilities of the household, but he harbours big dreams for his children; he wants them to receive an education and secure government jobs. Sanvi\u2019s parents were aware of the necessity of English language skills for employment, but she had developed a fear of the language. Moreover, her parents couldn\u2019t afford a private tutor. An opportunity came knocking when Pratham\u2019s volunteers visited their doorstep, mobilising children for the English Winter Camp. Initially hesitant and shy, Sanvi faced challenges with fluency and pronunciation, but with a zeal for learning and guidance from dedicated volunteers, she began practicing tasks each day at the camp. Through community engagement, the English Winter Camp, \u2018Fun with English 2.0\u2019, aimed to encourage children to learn English by making it fun and interesting, thereby eliminating their fear of the language. Sanvi became focused and active in warm-up activities and games, and her parents noticed a change in her spoken English skills. Daily practices of warm-up activities, audio stories, and games brought remarkable improvements in their speaking, reading, and writing skills, and Sanvi\u2019s fear of the English language began to diminish. As Sanvi stood reciting lines with fluency and precision, her parents felt that this program should run every three months so that children can continue to practice and make further progress in spoken English. \u201cSanvi knew very little English before attending the camp; now she can form sentences, and her fear towards learning the language has also disappeared,\" her father says. \n\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Us\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Pratham  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBoard  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLeadership  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPartners  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tPrograms\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEducation  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVocational Training   \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnnual Status of Education Report  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPratham Council For Vulnerable Children  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCovid Response  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLearning Readiness & Catch Up  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLessons from the Pandemic  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tGet Involved\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJob Opportunities  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInternships  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tDelhi Office\t\t\t\t\t\t \nB- 4/59, Safdarjung Enclave\n1st Floor, New Delhi - 110 029\nEmail: info@pratham.org\nContact number: 01141651638\n\n\t\t Mumbai Office \nY.B.

Thanks to my work, I get to travel a lot. I visit schools in different corners of the country \u2013 remote villages, small towns and also schools in big city slums. Spending time with children, talking to teachers is one of my favourite activities. Any school big or small has a unique identity and its own special flavor. What happens in the classroom, how children chat with each other, sharing, exchanging, playground interactions, environment in the community \u2013 all of these contribute to the school\u2019s special character. Over the years, I have travelled a lot, spent time in many schools but a few schools have left a deep imprint in my memory. Today I want to tell you about one such school. Even in a quick glance at the map, you will see West Bengal as a big triangle for the bottom half with a thinner, longer section for the top half of the state. Right in the middle is Malda. As soon as you step across the border in this district, you can be in Jharkhand, Bihar or Bangladesh. If you leave Sealdah station in Kolkata at night, you will reach Malda at dawn. At some point, while it is still the dark, the train passes through Farakka. When you hear the word \u201cMalda\u201d, instantly, mangoes dance before your eyes. And sure enough, as the train pulls into Malda station, the mango orchards, which you see everywhere, lie waiting in the soft early morning golden sunshine. The school of my story is not very far from the district headquarters. You can get there in less than two hours. A good road goes almost all the way. For the final stretch, you have to walk down a narrow, often muddy and slippery path to reach the Mahananda river. There you will find a long wooden boat waiting to take you to the other side. Everyone travels on this boat. Some people carry bags, sacks and even boxes. Some cycle down to the river and then put their cycle on the boat. Others bring their goats and cattle to cross over. At school time, the boat is crowded with children in school uniforms carrying their school bags. We too reached the school this way.  Across the river, up the slope, through the mango grove, we get to the school compound. It is a small building, neatly painted in blue and white. As soon as you see it, you can feel that the building has been made and maintained with loving care and close attention. Walking from the school gate to the building, you can step on big blue and white squares on the ground. English and Bangla alphabets are painted in each square. Flowers and shrubs line the verandah. A peaceful, lovely environment. But the school did not always look like this. Sixty years ago, the people of the panchayat established this school. Then it was a simple one room made of mud. The village people wanted their children to have the same educational opportunities like city children did. In 1986, flood in the Mahananda river washed away the school. Quickly, the villagers built the school again. Some years later, with a government grant, five permanent rooms were constructed. It was good to have a building that would last a long time but to make the rooms beautiful and attractive for children, the villagers worked closely with school teachers. Even after so many years, the school was shining as if it was built yesterday. \nThe children were like the building, or perhaps it is better to turn that around and say the building was like the children \u2013 happy and colourful. When children and teachers like being with each other, teaching and learning become effective and strong. If children like spending time in school, then students\u2019 attendance is never a problem and teachers\u2019 presence is assured. If parents are happy with what is going on in school, then their support and cooperation is guaranteed.  I loved the way the school welcomed their guests. A big pan leaf, a ripe mango and a handful of flowers were offered to me. Often when you go to a school, teachers smother you with formalities. But here it was not at all like that. The head teacher urged me to go to each and every class and spend time with the children. Talking to children, big and small, it seemed to me that they were used to meeting visitors. They were keen to share their thoughts and happy to tell you their stories. They were also quick to demand that I do something with them. Most of the time, children chatted easily with me. Occasionally, their teacher would prompt some child to join the discussion. In fact, I learned about the school from these conversations. \nFrom the children, I learned that everyone loved books and stories. We decided that together with their teachers, they must write a book. The stories, the writing, the illustrations \u2013 all would be done by people in the school.

Due to her family\u2019s financial situation, she had to drop out of school after Grade 8. Her father worked as a farmhand and income was irregular, which left her mother as the sole provider of the family. Kaleena gave up on her educational dreams so that her younger sister could complete college. Happiness, however, eluded her even after marriage. She had a difficult marriage. It was only after the birth of her second child that Kaleena found the strength to leave her husband. Their separation marked a new beginning for Kaleena and her children \u2014 Khushi (7 years) and Yachna (10 years). Determined to rebuild her life, Kaleena trained as a beautician and started stitching clothes at home to support her family. At the time, her mother shouldered the farm responsibilities while her father worked at a steel factory in Raipur, and visited them occasionally. In 2021, Pratham approached mothers from Kaleena\u2019s village to form a Mothers\u2019 Group and support their children\u2019s learning. Kaleena was selected to be the \u2018leader mother\u2019 since she assisted other mothers in understanding and conducting learning activities for their children. Pratham provided the mothers with idea cards, activity suggestions and worksheets for their children. For mothers who couldn\u2019t attend the meetings, Kaleena was tasked to visit their homes and demonstrate the activities. \u201cWe do not hesitate to talk to others or make simple decisions anymore. Seeing other mothers understand their worth and come forward to fulfill their children\u2019s dreams makes me very happy. I want each mother to know her worth. If they are determined, they can do anything,\u201d she said. The impact has been profound. Children, once shy, now exhibit enthusiasm for learning, while mothers revel in their newfound confidence. Inspired by the profound changes she witnessed, Kaleena decided to chase her dreams further. In 2023, she enrolled in Pratham\u2019s Second Chance program to complete her Grade 10. In 2024, she cleared Grade 10 exam and wants to study further. She has even encouraged a few mothers in her village to join the Second Chance program. Today, Kaleena is a new version of herself. Her story echoes beyond her personal triumph and it\u2019s an inspiration for other mothers in the village. She is no longer under the control of circumstances and makes her own decisions.\u00a0 \n\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Us\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Pratham  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBoard  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLeadership  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPartners  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tPrograms\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEducation  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVocational Training   \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnnual Status of Education Report  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPratham Council For Vulnerable Children  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCovid Response  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLearning Readiness & Catch Up  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLessons from the Pandemic  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tGet Involved\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJob Opportunities  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInternships  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tDelhi Office\t\t\t\t\t\t \nB- 4/59, Safdarjung Enclave\n1st Floor, New Delhi - 110 029\nEmail: info@pratham.org\nContact number: 01141651638\n\n\t\t Mumbai Office \nY.B.

However, due to familial and societal pressures, she got married at the age of 21, soon after completing her Bachelor\u2019s degree. Her family arranged her marriage into a household where women were often confined to their homes. Pravesh's dreams of building a career were set aside, and despite her eagerness, she struggled to find support within her family. Pravesh's family, comprising six members, relied on her husband's contract work related to SIM card porting. Their 11-year-old son, Arnav, is in Grade 3, and her father-in-law was a former Sarpanch of the village. In 2021, when Pratham reached Pravesh's village, the primary focus was on educational activities, including learning camps in schools and community classes for children, facilitated by dedicated volunteers. Pratham\u2019s team started creating mothers' groups in the community to support early childhood education. Initially hesitant due to the restrictions at home, Pravesh eventually agreed to participate in a mothers' group after understanding the positive impact it could have on her child's learning. These groups met weekly at Pravesh's house, discussing various learning activities and sharing their experiences while engaging with their children at home. Pravesh, with her education and understanding of the activities, emerged as the natural leader of the group. Together, they had a profound impact on the children and the entire village by promoting education and fostering women's active involvement. One significant moment came when the group decided to meet at the village school. Pravesh yearned to attend but faced resistance at home. Unfortunately, she had to miss the meeting, leaving her feeling disheartened. In April 2023, a team from Nigeria visited the village to get a deeper understanding of Pratham's programs. The mothers of the group decided to meet the visitors as a united front, and Pravesh, as the group leader, was eager to join them but was skeptical if she would be allowed to step out of the house. The other mothers and Pratham team members passionately urged her family to grant permission for her to participate in the meeting with the visitors, extending a warm invitation to the family to join the occasion. Fortunately, the family allowed Pravesh to attend the meeting. During the visit, Pravesh spoke with the visitors in English and translated their questions and responses for the other mothers in Hindi. Her ability to bridge the language gap left the villagers, along with her family, deeply impressed and proud of her. This incident marked a turning point in Pravesh's life. Her family no longer restricted her from leaving the house, and this inspiring story prompted other families to reevaluate their constraints on women, allowing them to connect more freely. Pravesh's journey continues to evolve as she collaborates with Pratham, contributing significantly to children's learning and inspiring many. Her message to other women is clear: \u201cDon't give up on your dreams. Small efforts can lead to significant accomplishments and inspire others.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Us\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Pratham  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBoard  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLeadership  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPartners  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tPrograms\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEducation  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVocational Training   \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnnual Status of Education Report  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPratham Council For Vulnerable Children  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCovid Response  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLearning Readiness & Catch Up  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLessons from the Pandemic  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tGet Involved\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJob Opportunities  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInternships  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tDelhi Office\t\t\t\t\t\t \nB- 4/59, Safdarjung Enclave\n1st Floor, New Delhi - 110 029\nEmail: info@pratham.org\nContact number: 01141651638\n\n\t\t Mumbai Office \nY.B.

He lives in Bharukhera village in Haryana\u2019s Sirsa district, with his parents, grandmother, and a younger sister. Chirag has faced speech difficulties since his childhood, struggling with communicating. His father, a farmer, faced financial constraints that limited his ability to provide quality care and medical support to Chirag. In 2022, when Chirag was five, Pratham\u2019s team members met him at the Anganwadi centre in his village.\u00a0 Chirag's story took a turning point with the intervention of Pratham's ECE (Early Childhood Education) program. Through a carefully crafted curriculum, emphasizing on physical, cognitive, social, emotional, language, and math development, the program engaged with Chirag in a way that was never done before. Activities like paper folding, ball games, and colouring, and engaging conversations with friends along with joyful rhymes, played a pivotal role in boosting Chirag's confidence. At first, Chirag was hesitant, but he gradually began participating and enjoying the activities like counting and jumping exercises. His favourite rhyme, 'Ek Mota Hathi' became a symbol of his progress. He showed remarkable progress with continuous support from the Anganwadi teacher and Pratham's team members. He began to actively engage with his friends, sing songs, and gained competence in counting and reading. The impact extended beyond Chirag's learning levels.

She has three sons, daughters-in-law, and three grandchildren. The family's livelihood is sustained through labour work and Dadi's old-age pension. Dadi's association with Pratham began in 2020 during a volunteer mobilization drive. Her enthusiasm for the initiative was truly inspiring. She quickly became a passionate advocate for ensuring there were no gaps in her grandchildren\u2019s education. Her granddaughter, Nidhi, inspired by her Dadi's dedication, embarked on a journey as a Pratham volunteer. Nidhi's commitment, in turn, led to her younger siblings, Kafi and Prince, actively participating in Pratham's Children's Club activities. Dadi's influence extended far beyond her immediate family. She has affectionately named the children\u2019s group, the Bhagat Singh group. She engages with the eight learners in the group with stories inspired by their daily lives, and their learning activities begin with her tales and end with her entertaining riddle-guessing games. Dadi's stories, featuring characters like \u201cRaja-Rani,\" \u201cJungle ka Raja,\" and \u201cAkbar-Birbal,\" have become an integral part of their educational journey. She is equally excited about Pratham's learning games like \u201cTali Chutki\" and \u201cTodo Jodo\". Dadi's bond with the children is unwavering. Whenever she is unwell, they express their concern by visiting her, strengthening the connection that fuels her determination to bring joy to their lives. Recently, Dadi's heartwarming gesture captured the entire village's attention. She used her pension to purchase a blackboard for the children, addressing a long-standing need. This board has become a valuable asset, enhancing the children's camp activities and bringing them immense joy. Dadi's aspirations don't stop here. She envisions establishing a shared library for all the children's club groups in the village, with support from the community. Her desire is rooted in a strong belief: \u201cI never attended school, and I couldn't provide higher education opportunities to my sons, but I am determined to ensure that my grandchildren and other children in the village receive adequate education to become independent.\" Dadi Rajpati is a shining example of the impact Pratham's initiatives can have, both at a personal and community level.

At the age of 11, she is a grade 6 student hailing from Seehmai Karirat village in Ambedkar Nagar, Uttar Pradesh. Aradhya was eagerly looking forward to spending her summer vacation at her maternal grandparents' place, but when she heard about CAMaL Ka Camp, she felt torn, thinking she wouldn't be able to join her friends since she had to leave in just 2-3 days. As the camp started, an enthusiastic volunteer \u2013 Shiva, began with a fun warm-up activity that all the children thoroughly enjoyed. Watching her friends engrossed in the activities, Aradhya couldn't help but feel curious. Her friends and the volunteer convinced her to participate, even if it was just for two days. Persuaded by their excitement, Aradhya agreed. In the first two days, Aradhya and her friends wholeheartedly participated in the learning activities and games that created an atmosphere of joy and excitement. Among the highlights, her favourite was the 'Kahani Train' stories, a daily audio story that ends with an interacting session. These stories captivated her imagination. As the second day came to a close, Aradhya found herself feeling upset about leaving the camp to visit her grandparents. She had grown so fond of the camp and its experiences that she didn't want to miss out on any more fun. In a touching display of camaraderie, Aradhya's friends decided to intervene and approached her parents. They made a request and pleaded to allow Aradhya to stay and continue participating in the summer camp instead of going to her grandparents' place. Delighted by the children's enthusiasm and their daughter's eagerness to learn, Aradhya's parents readily agreed, cancelling the holiday plans. During her time at the camp, Aradhya made remarkable progress in her reading abilities. Although she could initially read only simple words, by the end of the camp, she had advanced to reading simple stories\u2014an incredible achievement! \n\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Us\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Pratham  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBoard  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLeadership  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPartners  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tPrograms\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEducation  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVocational Training   \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnnual Status of Education Report  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPratham Council For Vulnerable Children  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCovid Response  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLearning Readiness & Catch Up  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLessons from the Pandemic  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tGet Involved\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJob Opportunities  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInternships  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tDelhi Office\t\t\t\t\t\t \nB- 4/59, Safdarjung Enclave\n1st Floor, New Delhi - 110 029\nEmail: info@pratham.org\nContact number: 01141651638\n\n\t\t Mumbai Office \nY.B.

She lives with her husband, Suraj Kappa, their four-year-old son, mother-in-law, father-in-law and a sister-in-law. Suraj, who works as a roadside painter, would run into financial hurdles during the monsoon season when his work got stalled. Saraswati, who studied till Grade 9, came in touch with Pratham in November 2021 as part of its Swaad Kart project. The primary goal of this project was to empower women within the target communities by identifying potential entrepreneurs and assisting them in establishing small yet profitable food businesses. At a community meeting held in a nearby village, Saraswati showed keen interest in being trained to run her own food business. This proved to be a turning point in her life. Saraswati and her fellow participants underwent comprehensive training by a team from Pratham\u2019s Entrepreneurship Development program. They learnt various aspects of entrepreneurship such as initiating a business and understanding compliance requirements. The idea was to ensure that the participants gained necessary skills in order to independently operate and sustain their businesses.\u00a0 Saraswati learnt how to make momos and set up a food stall in April 2022.

With her mother earning Rs 125/day, education became a distant dream, leading to Jilanba dropping out of school in Grade 10. Her elder brother had to stop his education as well. Grieving for her father, Jilanba stopped doing all the things, like playing kabaddi and listening to music, that made her happy. Opportunity came in the form of Pratham\u2019s Second Chance program. Nikoda village had an active group of volunteers who ran the Hamara Gaon program \u2013 Pratham\u2019s flagship initiative. When Pratham\u2019s Second Chance team visited her village, they asked the volunteers of the Hamara Gaon program if there was any candidate in the community who could be supported with the Second Chance program. That is when they came in contact with Jilanba\u2019s mother, who expressed her heartfelt desire to see Jilanba's dreams, particularly her ambition to become a police officer, come true. She was more than happy to let Jilanba resume her education through this second chance. As Jilanba embraced education once again, her dreams of becoming a police officer were rekindled. Now an active class captain, she is thriving academically and encouraging other women in her village to join the program. \u201cPratham has given me the chance to dream again.

She didn\u2019t know that she would get a second chance to complete her school education almost 20 years after she left school. Summaia had to drop out of school after Grade 9 due to financial challenges at home and got married early. Busy with household and childcare responsibilities, she never thought she would get back to her studies. When her daughter learned about Pratham's Second Chance program at her tailoring class, she encouraged Summaia to join. The Second Chance program is designed to help women and girls, who couldn't finish school, to complete their Grade 10 exams. Summaia was hesitant to join at first, but she knew that it was her chance to get an education and help her family. Summaia found going back to studies after a long gap difficult. Her classes were held at a cluster centre in her neighborhood. She would go to the class after finishing her household chores. Her husband and mother helped her take care of her children so that she could focus on her studies. But soon, tragedy struck when her mother passed away while she was preparing for the Grade 10 board exam. It was a challenging phase, but she gathered herself and resumed her preparations. In 2022, Summaia took her Grade 10 Board exams. She worked hard and scored an impressive 89%. She was so happy that she had finally achieved her dream of getting an education. Currently, Summaia works at a nutrition centre. She now advises and guides people on leading healthy lives. She is so grateful for the Second Chance program, which gave her the opportunity to get an education and change her life. Summaia's story is an inspiration to others who have had to put their education on hold. She shows that it is never too late to learn and achieve your dreams.

Hailing from a modest background in Pune\u2019s slum area, Maharashtra, Pallavi faced financial constraints that forced her to discontinue her education after Grade 8 in 2008. She decided to help her family financially. Three years after dropping out of school, she was offered a lifeline by Pratham\u2019s Second Chance team, providing her with an opportunity to complete her secondary education. Eagerly enrolling in the program, she attended classes at the center, not only acquiring knowledge and new friendships but also reigniting her passion for higher education. Pallavi passed Grade X exams with an impressive 70% score in 2012. However, financial challenges continued to loom over her. Fortunately, she was selected for an educational sponsorship from the Suprabhat Mahila Mandal, an NGO dedicated to supporting students\u2019 education in Pune. This support enabled Pallavi to complete her Grade XII in 2014 with a score of 75%. She fondly recalls the guidance and motivation from her mentors, especially Vandana Tai, who became a beacon of inspiration for her. Pallavi\u2019s mentors facilitated a paid internship for her which eventually transformed into a full-time job, encouraging her to pursue higher education while balancing work and studies. Her time at the company allowed Pallavi to explore different aspects of the business, fostering a deep interest in HR and Accounts. She wanted to get an MBA. Yet, the \u201cexternal\u201d tag on her M.Com marksheet, indicating her non-attendance in a regular college for the course, troubled her.

Serving as a role model for her younger siblings, who also completed their education, Pallavi\u2019s success brought immense pride to her mother, a strong advocate for her education.

She lives with her father, who is a farmer, her mother, a homemaker, and her two younger siblings. Coming from a marginalized background, opportunities did not come easily to her. Her father\u2019s income was barely enough to make ends meet. Amid such dire financial situation, Sarojani was forced to sacrifice her education. She dropped out of school after Grade 9 and began looking for work. However, it proved to be a challenge since she hadn\u2019t completed her education and lacked professional skills. During the COVID-19 lockdown, she heard about the automotive course under Pratham Skilling from her friends and enrolled for an online course. It didn\u2019t bother her that she was the only girl in the class; she was determined to complete the course. While doing the course, Sarojani started looking for a garage where she could practice everything she learned in the class. She met the owner of Geeta Garage in Bilaigarh and convinced him to hire her. The on-the-job training helped her hone her skills and learn more about servicing automobiles. The owner of the garage was impressed with her dedication and hard work and offered her a permanent job. She started with a salary of INR 4,000 per month. At the time, Pratham had asked her if she was interested in joining the organization. That, however, involved relocating to Raipur, the capital city of Chhattisgarh, and she was reluctant to move out of her village. Almost a month ago, Sarojani\u2019s father suffered a paralytic attack. As a result, her burden of responsibility increased. She was not only responsible for the household expenses but also for the education of her siblings. Pratham again approached her, offering the job of an assistant trainer at the Raipur Automotive Centre. This time, she accepted the offer with a monthly salary of INR 13.5K. After joining work, Sarojani recently enrolled in Pratham\u2019s Second Chance Program to complete her Grade 10 exams. \n\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Us\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Pratham  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBoard  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLeadership  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPartners  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tPrograms\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEducation  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVocational Training   \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnnual Status of Education Report  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPratham Council For Vulnerable Children  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCovid Response  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLearning Readiness & Catch Up  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLessons from the Pandemic  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tGet Involved\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJob Opportunities  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInternships  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tDelhi Office\t\t\t\t\t\t \nB- 4/59, Safdarjung Enclave\n1st Floor, New Delhi - 110 029\nEmail: info@pratham.org\nContact number: 01141651638\n\n\t\t Mumbai Office \nY.B.

As the eldest among three siblings, she was a role model to her younger siblings. She was a star student and made her family proud by scoring 86% in her Grade VIII examinations. However, misfortune struck the family when her father suffered a paralytic attack. Soon after, her mother was diagnosed with an intestinal disorder and her younger brother was affected by a nervous disorder. Amid these challenging conditions, Siddhi had to make the tough decision of dropping out of school to support her family financially. In 2012, after discontinuing her studies, Siddhi started tailoring work. During a community mobilization drive in 2016, Siddhi and her family met Pratham\u2019s team and learned about the Second Chance Program. She feared that she might not be able to clear Grade 10 exams after a three-year gap, but her family gave her the much-needed encouragement to enroll in the program. Initially, when she struggled with basic concepts, she questioned her decision of joining the program. However, as the course progressed and started delving into subject-wise curriculum, Siddhi's interest piqued. She started attending classes regularly, while managing her familial responsibilities. She scored 76% in her board exams. Pratham's Second Chance program was a turning point in her life. Siddhi gradually became ambitious and decided to study further. She started her higher secondary classes while supporting her studies with her tailoring work. Due to family constraints, it took her two years to complete Grade XII in 2019 through open school. She also supported the Pisangan block as a facilitator. Currently, she is pursuing her Bachelor's in Arts. She's also been the Subject Content and Teaching Assistant of Home Science in the Rajasthan Second Chance program since October 2020.\u00a0 Her journey from being a student to a state content expert serves as an example to young girls and women who have dropped out of school, whom she encounters during community mobilization drives. She says that she was inspired by her teachers in Second Chance, and now it's her motive to extend similar support to other girls and women. \n\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Us\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Pratham  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBoard  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLeadership  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPartners  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tPrograms\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEducation  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVocational Training   \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnnual Status of Education Report  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPratham Council For Vulnerable Children  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCovid Response  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLearning Readiness & Catch Up  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLessons from the Pandemic  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tGet Involved\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJob Opportunities  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInternships  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tDelhi Office\t\t\t\t\t\t \nB- 4/59, Safdarjung Enclave\n1st Floor, New Delhi - 110 029\nEmail: info@pratham.org\nContact number: 01141651638\n\n\t\t Mumbai Office \nY.B.

More than twenty years ago, Pratham\u2019s work began with pre-schools in the urban slums of Mumbai, Today Pratham has grown both in scope and geographical coverage. Currently, Pratham has activities in 23 states and UTs and implements programs that include activities for pre-school and elementary school age groups, dropout girls and women as well as vocational skilling programs for youth. As one of the largest non-governmental organizations in the country, Pratham focuses on high-quality, low-cost, and replicable interventions to address gaps in the education system. The mission to improve the quality of education in India and ensure that all children not only attend but also thrive in school is being accomplished by working in collaboration with the government, local communities, parents, teachers, volunteers, and civil society members. Our programs aim to supplement rather than replace governmental efforts. They are implemented on a large scale to not only reach as many children as possible, but also to enable an adoptable demonstration model for governments and other partners.

About the ENABLE ProgramThe National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 emphasizes the fundamental importance of universal foundational literacy and numeracy (FLN). The policy asserts that all other aspects are relevant only if children acquire these essential skills during primary school. Children, especially those with special needs and disabilities, face significant barriers hindering their acquisition of foundational skills. In India, an estimated 7.8 million children and young individuals had disabilities in 2019. Alarmingly, a large proportion of them do not attend educational institutions, and 45% struggle to attain foundational literacy. Urgent, concerted efforts and inclusive education initiatives are vital to help these children overcome obstacles, fostering their full potential. Fortunately, existing policy frameworks, technological advancements, and governmental commitment offer a unique opportunity to address this pressing need. ENABLE' or 'Equity in Accessing Numeracy And Basic Literacy Education', is a multi-pronged intervention to strengthen the quality of education for 3-9 year olds with disabilities.

Through the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER), our work in education policy has given citizens, governments and nonprofits a voice in education reform internationally.\u00a0 Pratham\u2019s flagship literacy program, \"Read India\", has demonstrated that children can learn more efficiently when grouped according to ability rather than age. What started with a single preschool in the slums of Mumbai has evolved to reach 45 million children and youth through literacy and vocational programs in 20 Indian states. Our contributions to education have been internationally recognised with accolades including the Asia Game Changer Award, the BBVA Frontiers of Knowledge Award, the WISE Prize for Education, and the Skoll Award for Social Entrepreneurship.

Esther Duflo, left, and Abhijit Banerjee, the winners of 2019 Nobel Prize for Economics, following a news conference at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Mass., Monday, Oct. 14, 2019.(AP) Ford Foundation international professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Abhijit Banerjee and his wife Esther Duflo, who are among the three honoured with this year\u2019s Nobel Prize in economics, have a Bihar connection. The couple came to Bihar in 2010 in connection with the impact assessment of the nationwide \u2018Read India\u2019 campaign, launched by Pratham to ensure that all children in India are able to read fluently and do basic math confidently. Pratham, an educational NGO, has produced an Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) since 2005, which has amply demonstrated the challenges in terms of learning outcomes of children.. It was in January 2010 that Banerjee and Dufflo participated in the Research and Policy Design - the first J-PAL Bihar Development Conference in Patna. Deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi was also present at the function. At the function, Banerjee said that it was important to engage with people at the helm of affairs to ensure policy interventions to bring about much-needed change for poverty alleviation. He also referred to the summer camp intervention in Bettiah to help children catch up to have knowledge commensurate with the class they studied in. \u201cLearning outcomes can be improved if it is first accepted and an effective programme evolved to tackle it,\u201d he added. Banerjee was also involved with \u2018Read India\u2019 activities organised in 3 blocks in West Champaran district in Bihar. He also wrote the research paper with Pratham CEO Rukmini Banerji on \u2018Read India - Every Child in School and Learning Well Helping Primary School Students in India Acquire Basic Reading and Math Skills\u2019. \u201cThis impact evaluation study is interesting for a variety of reasons. It attempts to understand the effects of large scale efforts like Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) and Read India. Second, the partnership for the study and the interventions involves a university (MIT), state government of Bihar and an NGO. Working effectively within a three way partnership has its own challenges but as this study indicates, effective partnerships are possible,\u201d said the paper in its concluding remark. Pratham CEO Banerji said that Abhijit Banerjee had evaluated the summer camps programme run by Pratham in coordination with the Bihar government as well as the \u2018Read India\u2019. \u201cHe found the summer camps very effective. He was also receptive to feedback to make changes in accordance with local needs to ensure optimum benefit to the target groups for tackling poverty,\u201d she added. \"Our vision is to end the cycle of poverty in India by providing access to education.

Every sportsperson dreams of a podium finish. I really cannot express my joy of winning a medal in words! I made a small mistake, otherwise, I definitely could have bagged gold. Many things were going through my mind as I entered the lifting arena, after all this was my maiden Nationals\u2019. Thus spoke diminutive Gautam Kumar! All of 5 feet, he lifted 177 kg, in the 49 kg category at the recently concluded National Weightlifting Championship held in Kanyakumari, Tamil Nadu. 18-year-old Gautam won a bronze for this stellar performance.\u00a0 A native of Bhithiharwa village of Gaunaha block, West Champaran district, Gautam was spotted by Pratham Education Foundation\u2019s Sumit Pandey, a sports trainer, who moved with the Pratham team to Gaunaha block of West Champaran, when Pratham collaborated with DMI, Patna to work towards overall social development of a cluster of 13 villages of Gaunaha in 2017. Sumit Pandey, our sports trainer was impressed with Gautam\u2019s precocious ability the moment he saw him lift weights in Bhithiharwa Buniyaadi Vidyalaya. He was just 14, and for his age, weight and height his lifting ability was phenomenal. Sumit took him under his folds and nurtured him to join the Eklavya Vidyalaya in Sitamarhi. Gautam now trains in Kankarbagh Sports Complex and also stays there. He aspires to represent India soon. \u2018A Guru\u2019s joy has no bounds when his pupil attempts to reach the pinnacle of success and achieves it. Today, Gautam the champion lifter was welcomed at his ancestral village in Bhithiharwa with great fanfare. I have never seen such joy and\u00a0enthusiasm amongst the youth and children of the village. And bestowing such respect, which will be remembered for a long time! The seed that was sown by Pratham Education Foundation, has gradually turned into a sapling. Today, Pratham\u2019s exemplary work in this area is being lauded by all\u2019 said a beaming Sumit Pandey! Many congratulations to Gautam and Sumit from Pratham family!

Every sportsperson dreams of a podium finish. I really cannot express my joy of winning a medal in words! I made a small mistake, otherwise, I definitely could have bagged gold. Many things were going through my mind as I entered the lifting arena, after all this was my maiden Nationals\u2019. Thus spoke diminutive Gautam Kumar! All of 5 feet, he lifted 177 kg, in the 49 kg category at the recently concluded National Weightlifting Championship held in Kanyakumari, Tamil Nadu. 18-year-old Gautam won a bronze for this stellar performance.\u00a0 A native of Bhithiharwa village of Gaunaha block, West Champaran district, Gautam was spotted by Pratham Education Foundation\u2019s Sumit Pandey, a sports trainer, who moved with the Pratham team to Gaunaha block of West Champaran, when Pratham collaborated with DMI, Patna to work towards overall social development of a cluster of 13 villages of Gaunaha in 2017. Sumit Pandey, our sports trainer was impressed with Gautam\u2019s precocious ability the moment he saw him lift weights in Bhithiharwa Buniyaadi Vidyalaya. He was just 14, and for his age, weight and height his lifting ability was phenomenal. Sumit took him under his folds and nurtured him to join the Eklavya Vidyalaya in Sitamarhi. Gautam now trains in Kankarbagh Sports Complex and also stays there. He aspires to represent India soon. \u2018A Guru\u2019s joy has no bounds when his pupil attempts to reach the pinnacle of success and achieves it. Today, Gautam the champion lifter was welcomed at his ancestral village in Bhithiharwa with great fanfare. I have never seen such joy and\u00a0enthusiasm amongst the youth and children of the village. And bestowing such respect, which will be remembered for a long time! The seed that was sown by Pratham Education Foundation, has gradually turned into a sapling. Today, Pratham\u2019s exemplary work in this area is being lauded by all\u2019 said a beaming Sumit Pandey! Many congratulations to Gautam and Sumit from Pratham family!

This is, one of the KGBVs where Pratham engages with the girls and teachers.Way back in 1917, when Gandhiji came to Champaran to understand the problems that the indigo farmers were having with the British, an ashram was established in Bhithiharva. It was like a \u201cbase camp\u201d for the team. Many of their friends and family from all over India came to help in the Neel Satyagraha. While Gandhiji travelled throughout Champaran visiting farmers, Kasturba stayed mostly in the ashram in Bhithiharva where she worked with local communities to instill hygiene awareness for girls and women, cleanliness in the community, and education for children.I hope I can visit this Kasturba Vidyalaya soon! However, to deal with my \u2018wait period\u2019, we planned video chats on Zoom with the girls. The girls are in grades 6, 7 and 8 in the KGBV at Bhithiharva. Priyanka Kumari, one of the two Pratham Leader Didis in Bihar, organized the first zoom call.The girls were out sitting in groups, with their teacher and the Pratham Didis \u2013 Jyoti and Sushmita. It was four in the afternoon and one could sense the atmosphere of reading with discussion, watching them in the sun through Sushmita\u2019s cell phone! We decided to ask questions, one question to each group. Here were the kinds of questions put to the girls: What do you like about your village (where you live with your family), what one thing you would like to change in your village if you could, and what do you all like to do on a holiday? Which cities/ places have you visited? How are daughters and sons different in your village? Have you heard/ know of child marriage in your village, in the last year? Have you used smartphones? For what purposes are smartphones used? Jyoti and Sushmita encouraged the girls in each group to discuss the question and the responses before talking to me. \u00a0The Didis took the Zoom-call phone from group to group so that the girls could talk to me. This worked well.\u00a0 For some questions, all groups raised their hand, they all wanted to talk to me about the it ll! Pinky from a village near the Nepal border talked of the need for roads in her village, and that the school is only till grade 5. Education in their villages was not accessible. Roads were difficult. Also, parents did not allow girls to go outside the village. The girls told us that in a couple of villages near Bhithiharva see child marriages still happening. \u201cit has happened in my village\", says Manju, a girl from a nearby village. More girls pitched in saying they have heard and seen 14\u201315-year-old girls get married. If someone tries to explain why early marriages should not happen, the girls said, \u201cthe parents say \u2013 the girl is our daughter and they do not wish for suggestions.\" About smartphones, the girls like to listen to music and watch videos! They also use smartphones when the Pratham Didi sent them worksheets during the lockdown and holidays!The girls want to study more, though they do not know many options of what to study and what they wish to become. With much probing, they came up with teaching, going into the army, and joining the police force.  They do want to go to high school and college.This Kasturba Vidyalaya has provision for girls to study up to grade 10. However, everyone is waiting for the new construction to be completed. The high school is at a short distance, they can manage that part they said, but having a proper place to stay is what parents think is critical to leave their daughters at the KGBV. The girls love to sing and dance, watch videos and do their hair in different styles on a holiday. This Kasturba Vidyalaya has an enviable team for Kabaddi. The team has won district and state-level Kabaddi matches.The Pratham Didis learn and help the girls learn well too.We did not realize that it was 50 minutes of gapshap and though I tried, I could remember only a few names of the girls.

Her early years were marked by financial hardship which prevented her from getting a formal education. Born into a family of daily wage labourers, she was the middle child among two brothers and three sisters. Bisro never went to school or got access to education until she was 16. At the age of 16, an opportunity emerged like a beacon of hope \u2013 a free Ratri Shala \u2013 a night school, an initiative by the people in her village. She seized the opportunity and enrolled herself at the Grade 5 level, but due to unforeseen circumstances, the school closed down, leaving her without a passing certificate. Bisro got married at the age of 18 and soon became a mother. Amid household and childcare responsibilities, her dreams of education were put on hold. She came to know of the \u2018Samtulyata Pariksha\u2019 program, a part of Sakshar Bharat, an initiative of the state government. This program offered another chance to pursue her studies, this time at Grade 8 in the local government school. But as her family grew, household responsibilities took precedence, and after completing Grade 8, she had to discontinue her education once again. After a gap of 15 years, at the age of 48, in 2023, Bisro was led to Pratham\u2019s Second Chance program, which was a turning point in her life. The Second Chance program is designed to help women and girls, who couldn\u2019t finish school, to complete their Grade 10 exams, in the hope that this academic certificate would further their opportunities for educational growth and employability. With the unwavering support of her family, Bisro embarked on this journey, which required her to cross a river to attend classes at the Second Chance centre. Despite facing taunts and societal judgements that questioned her decision to return to school at the age of 48, she remained resolute. After completing Grade 10, she now aspires to continue her education through an open board. She believes, \u201cLearning and education are not limited by age, and one should always seize the opportunity to learn.\u201d Bisro currently works as a government health worker in her village, known as a Mitanin. She took this job to support her family while effectively balancing her studies and job responsibilities. Bisro was driven from the very beginning. She felt the need of education every time she went to the bank or boarded the bus and wanted to read and understand herself, instead of seeking help from others. Her story is a testament to the idea that education knows no age limit and the boundless potential that resides within us. \n\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Us\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Pratham  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBoard  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLeadership  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPartners  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tPrograms\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEducation  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVocational Training   \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnnual Status of Education Report  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPratham Council For Vulnerable Children  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCovid Response  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLearning Readiness & Catch Up  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLessons from the Pandemic  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tGet Involved\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJob Opportunities  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInternships  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tDelhi Office\t\t\t\t\t\t \nB- 4/59, Safdarjung Enclave\n1st Floor, New Delhi - 110 029\nEmail: info@pratham.org\nContact number: 01141651638\n\n\t\t Mumbai Office \nY.B.

The grant will allow us to aid governments and NGOs in the design and scaling of Pratham\u2019s proven\u00a0Teaching at the Right Level\u00a0(TaRL) approach in multiple countries across Africa, including Ivory Coast, Nigeria and Zambia. This multi-year initiative will help three million primary school children learn to read and do basic arithmetic. What started in a Mumbai slum two and a half decades ago is now taking root on an international scale. Recently, the head of Pratham\u2019s content team, Usha Rane, reported from Niger, where she was leading the training of the local TaRL team. In Africa, like in India, Pratham instructors not only improve schooling and learning but, in doing so, also become deeply engaged with the children and their lives. Below is a firsthand account from Usha of how a set of determined and caring individuals mobilized action around the world to change the life of a child on the verge of blindness. Ibrahim (young boy in Niger): It is summer in Niger, a francophone country in West Africa. Hot summer. Sand floats around everywhere. A school building is mounted on the sand. I can breathe neem tree because I am standing under the only tree which is planted hardly around five meters away from the school. I see more than fifty young children entering the classroom. They are together. They are so much together that they look like one big fish swimming under the water of sand. They are making lots of noise, but they are together. They disappear inside the darkness of the classroom and I follow them with three master trainers in Pratham\u2019s teaching at the right level methodology. Master trainers will conduct the grade I and II activities and I will sit overseeing them with the help of an interpreter.  The children are now quiet. They are somewhat nervous because the master trainer is new to them. Other adults, too, who are sitting on the benches don\u2019t look familiar. The master trainer makes all the children sit on the floor and starts the class activities. I see that the students are listening to him with rapt attention. Now, they have forgotten about our presence and they are giggling, pushing each other to participate in the classroom activities. Almost every child is getting an opportunity to say something either in the whole class activity or in small group activities. One child has caught my attention right from the beginning, but I avoid looking at him. However, again and again, my eyes search for him and I instantly look away. On both his cheeks a small film has gathered. His nose is running too and his eyes are full of tears. I observe this in an instant glance and I feel, \u201cNo, I shouldn\u2019t look at him again.\u201d But the child with foam on his cheeks keeps raising his weak hand and keeps trying to draw the master trainer\u2019s attention in his meek voice. The master trainer avoids him. \u201cWhy am I trying to escape from him?\u201d I ask myself. \u201cNo, I can\u2019t. I should not do this,\u201d I say to myself. I get up from my seat and walk towards him. Actually, I want to clean his face with my dupatta. I want to scrub his face thoroughly. I think for a while and decide to hold his hand. I gently bring him to my desk. He is so weak and fragile that I feel he will just break if I put any force on him. I take out some tissues from my purse and wipe his face. Only few children and the translator notice this, but they don\u2019t say anything. The child goes back. I notice there are no expressions on his face. He is blank, but once again, his eyes are filled with tears. They drop slowly, the lather starts gathering and he gets busy with the classroom process. He tries to raise his hand and wishes to answer, but the master trainer ignores him. He is a boy who won\u2019t give up easily. I admire his drive. He keeps trying but with no luck. The classroom activities are over and there is nobody around me in the classroom. I walk out slowly and look out for Aki.  Aki (Japan International Cooperation Agency \u2013\u00a0JICA) Aki is a tiny, enthusiastic, young JICA employee. She is so very active that I always wonder where she gets her energy from. She has dedicated her life to children in Niger. She has been staying in Niger for many years and I don\u2019t think she has any plans to go back to Tokyo, where her home is. The dusty, sandy Niger has become her home. Aki is busy micromanaging things around her, organizing vehicles to take us to the location where we will have lunch, talking to people around her and giving instructions to the head teacher who will call the children the next day for practice class. I feel I should not disturb her because she is extremely busy. The Sun is not kind either. I wish to go and sit in the car instantly. But\u2026I hold Aki\u2019s hand and start searching for the child. And while doing this, I tell Aki that I must find this boy. Fortunately, he has not left the school yet. He is waiting for somebody and I rush towards him along with Aki. I tell Aki that I wish to know his name. I also tell her why. The child tells his name to Aki. He is waiting for his elder brother, who is studying in grade III. Aki listens to me intensely keeping all her work aside. I keep looking at her, expecting some positive response or at least a nod of affirmation. I tell her that I wish to help this child. Can he get the best of the best treatment in Niger? Or can we take him to some other country where he will be treated well for his ailment, which is slowly making him completely blind? Aki is thinking. We stand under the tree looking at a far distance in the desert without saying a single word. Breaking her silence, she slowly says, \u201cLet us talk to the head teacher.\u201d Headteacher He is a tall, very smart-looking young man. He can speak very little English and has a very promising smile. Talking to the head teacher is a good idea. He, too, listens to Aki absorbedly. When told about the boy, he looks at me with the utmost disbelief and says I won\u2019t be able to speak to the boy\u2019s father because he is in Benin, a nearby country where poor laborers migrate in search of work. The child\u2019s mother won\u2019t make any decision because she will not step out of her house. She probably doesn\u2019t understand French etc. etc. We keep staring at him. I see a gleam in the corner of his eyes. He smiles and in assuring tone says, \u201cI will send a message for his father. He will come to meet you all the way from Benin.\u201d Ibrahim\u2019s father A landless laborer in his thirties appears before us. He is holding Ibrahim\u2019s hand. He starts speaking, looking at Aki. He speaks for around a half hour. The four of us\u2014Aki, Ibrahim\u2019s father, Ibrahim and I\u2014are standing under the lonely neem tree. The breeze is cooling. He keeps explaining to Aki: what hasn\u2019t he done for this child, how he ran from pillar to post, how each time he was turned away, how difficult it is to feed the family of eight children\u2026. She never translates, but I understand. Then, there is silence. He is not a man who will vociferously say \u201cthank you.\u201d He touches his child\u2019s head and looks up at the sky. The Chinese hospital in Niyame The Chinese government has built a huge hospital with all modern facilities in Niyame. The services are provided at cost, but that is still not free of charge. Aki and I decide that we will first consult the local ophthalmologist, who is associated with the hospital. The doctors at the hospital tell Aki that they will not be able to treat Ibrahim in their hospital. I have to return to India and hence Aki personally starts running around to facilitate the preliminary checkup for Ibrahim. She bears all the costs of pathology while running around with the family from one center to another. Back home in India, I write to my colleagues, friends and relatives. The child\u2019s treatment will need money\u2014a substantial amount. And I get a response. Madhav writes to me, as expected. Madhav (Pratham, India) He writes a to-the-point e-mail. This is his style! He asks some pertinent queries and wants his queries answered quickly. I am in Peru. So Aki, in her Japanese accent with a heavy French intonation, explains the problem of Ibrahim to Madhav and sends him all the pathological reports. The reports are in French and they need to be translated into English. I accept the help of Laura from Paris. She tries her best, but the task is indeed difficult because it is translating medical transcripts without the proper understanding of medical terminology. Through video and e-mail exchanges, I learn that medical opinions are being gathered from expert practitioners in India. But the decision has to be made\u2014a decision about where the child should be operated on. In India or in Nigeria? Nigeria is a bordering country of Niger. Niger citizens don\u2019t need a visa. But there is a major problem. Nigeria is an anglophone country. Neither of the child\u2019s parents nor any close relative can speak English. Aki manages to find a gentleman who agrees to accompany Ibrahim\u2019s parents. She has gathered the courage to send the child to Nigeria. Madhav is an alchemist and also a catalyst. He has a unique ability to bring diverse forces together to turn them into positive energy. He finds a donor! Sapphira (Vijay and Marie Goradia Charitable Foundation, USA) I have never met her and have not even written to her. But when I think about her, I imagine a young girl who is empathetic about everything under the sky\u2014a pious soul. Tirelessly, she keeps in touch with Aki and they become a team. She connects with the\u00a0SightLife, a global health organization focused on eliminating corneal blindness. They help identify doctors in Nigeria, finds the best one and starts communicating with him. A seamless, absolutely grounded and genuine effort with no intention of getting any recognition\u2014I must meet Sapphira someday.  Dr. Fasina Yemi from Nigeria operates on Ibrahim Just one week ago, Aki sends the following e-mail to me: \u201cI hope you are doing fine. I just came back to Niger after several weeks travel to Japan and Ghana; then finally I saw Ibrahim yesterday. During his stay in Nigeria and when he came back home, I was not in Niger, but I could get the information from the hospital. He is fine. The operation was successfully done and he recovered very well the doctor said. Please find attached picture (unfortunately he was so nervous, he didn\u2019t smile!! So he didn\u2019t look fine\u2026but he is okay) He just has to stay at home because his nose is still fragile and must not be touched. I will try to make a video call sometime to the doctor in Nigeria to show him Ibrahim and discuss. Anyway, Ibrahim will have another consultation with the doctor at the Nigeria hospital in May, then if no problem, the treatment will be done. I hope everything is going well.\u201d Aki keeps transferring her energy. \n\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Us\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Pratham  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBoard  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLeadership  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPartners  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tPrograms\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEducation  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVocational Training   \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnnual Status of Education Report  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPratham Council For Vulnerable Children  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCovid Response  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLearning Readiness & Catch Up  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLessons from the Pandemic  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tGet Involved\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJob Opportunities  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInternships  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tDelhi Office\t\t\t\t\t\t \nB- 4/59, Safdarjung Enclave\n1st Floor, New Delhi - 110 029\nEmail: info@pratham.org\nContact number: 01141651638\n\n\t\t Mumbai Office \nY.B.

A once promising student, Dattatray was forced to drop out of school in the ninth grade to help support his family. For three years, he worked as an informal worker at a local garage, applying his drive and intelligence to cars rather than books. As his experience and understanding of automobiles grew, so did his ambition. Dattatray wanted formal employment that would allow him to better support his family. He even dreamed of one day opening his own garage. But without a high school diploma, what kind of job could he hope to get? His prospects limited, Dattatray was stuck. Then, one day, a friend told him about Pratham\u2019s vocational program in Panvel, three hours away. Not only would its automobile course allow Dattatray to polish his skills, but he would graduate with a certificate that would open up a new world of job opportunities. And Pratham\u2019s \u201clearn now, pay later\u201d option made all of this affordable. Dattatray had found a way out of his situation. Dattatray excelled in Pratham\u2019s vocational program, gradually playing a lead role in practical demonstrations. What\u2019s more, at the end of the course, he was one of the handful of students selected to receive seed money to start their own businesses. And it wasn\u2019t only his instructors who were impressed\u2014Dattatray was offered a position at the prestigious Tata Motors in Pune. Wherever his choices would take him, he was no longer stuck. \n\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Us\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Pratham  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBoard  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLeadership  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPartners  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tPrograms\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEducation  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVocational Training   \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnnual Status of Education Report  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPratham Council For Vulnerable Children  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCovid Response  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLearning Readiness & Catch Up  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLessons from the Pandemic  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tGet Involved\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJob Opportunities  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInternships  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tDelhi Office\t\t\t\t\t\t \nB- 4/59, Safdarjung Enclave\n1st Floor, New Delhi - 110 029\nEmail: info@pratham.org\nContact number: 01141651638\n\n\t\t Mumbai Office \nY.B.

Forced to work up to 20 hours a day in cramped, dimly lit rooms, their only payment was food to keep them alive. In 2006, when Pratham facilitated large-scale state rescue operations, Sunil was one of the fortunate ones to be freed. He was then enrolled in Pratham\u2019s Gyanshala program, which provides education and other support to those rescued from child labor. After their basic foundational skills are established, the children attend a nearby government school while continuing to live with fellow Gyanshala students. They are also exposed to music and sports. It was here that Sunil began to excel at kabaddi, a sport in which players must cross to the other team\u2019s half, touch an opponent and escape back to their own side\u2014all on a single breath. Today, Sunil is a confident, capable young man. He is among the 35% of students to have passed the grade 12 exam, scoring in the 65th percentile. He has also won many medals representing Bihar on the kabaddi court, where, as in life, he has been to the other side and made it back safely. He can now exhale. \n\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Us\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Pratham  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBoard  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLeadership  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPartners  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tPrograms\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEducation  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVocational Training   \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnnual Status of Education Report  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPratham Council For Vulnerable Children  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCovid Response  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLearning Readiness & Catch Up  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLessons from the Pandemic  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tGet Involved\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJob Opportunities  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInternships  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tDelhi Office\t\t\t\t\t\t \nB- 4/59, Safdarjung Enclave\n1st Floor, New Delhi - 110 029\nEmail: info@pratham.org\nContact number: 01141651638\n\n\t\t Mumbai Office \nY.B.

His penchant for mischief was renowned, and the community\u2014including the boy\u2019s parents\u2014had given up on him. He was, as one teacher put it, \u201con the wrong track.\u201d That was before educator Surendra Kumar invited him to a Pratham exploratory science workshop. \u201cInvited\u201d may not be the right word. More like \u201chounded.\u201d There were many visits by Surendra to Sumit\u2019s house to persuade him to attend a session of the program, which is part of a collaboration between Pratham and the local government designed to stimulate scientific curiosity among middle schoolers in rural India using Pratham\u2019s philosophy of \u201clearn by doing.\u201d His persistence seemed futile until one day, Sumit just showed up at class. At first, he was his usual self\u2014refusing to sit down or talk, gazing at a model of a magnetic train rather than listening to the teacher. Then the lights in the classroom went off. A film projector came on. Sumit sat in the darkness, listening to the voice of scientist Arvind Gupta, mesmerized by images of the inventor\u2019s experimental learning toys made from everyday objects: paper caps and houses\u2026magical match sticks\u2026a dancing man\u2026 Afterwards, the children were asked to make one toy of their choosing from the movie and bring it to the next session. The following day, each child waited to be called on to present their toy. But Sumit couldn\u2019t wait. \u201cLook!\u201d he shouted, holding up a series of objects one by one, \u201cMagical matchstick! A crocodile! A house! Dancing man!\u201d Sumit had created them all. He had even replicated the train that so fascinated him the day before. Stunned, Surendra asked Sumit to demonstrate his techniques to the others, which he was happy to do. With his passion for science awakened, Sumit went on to enroll in Pratham\u2019s science camp. He\u2019s on a different track now. \n\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Us\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Pratham  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBoard  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLeadership  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPartners  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tPrograms\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEducation  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVocational Training   \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnnual Status of Education Report  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPratham Council For Vulnerable Children  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCovid Response  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLearning Readiness & Catch Up  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLessons from the Pandemic  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tGet Involved\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJob Opportunities  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInternships  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tDelhi Office\t\t\t\t\t\t \nB- 4/59, Safdarjung Enclave\n1st Floor, New Delhi - 110 029\nEmail: info@pratham.org\nContact number: 01141651638\n\n\t\t Mumbai Office \nY.B.

With permission from his teacher, he asks me to follow him home. At the end of a narrow lane is Shivam\u2019s house. His mother, Rita, sits working at her sewing machine.

I ask her if she is happy that Shivam is going to Pratham, and she stops working. \u201cI am a mother, and for me the first priority is my child\u2019s education. I can\u2019t read or write.

A group of local children and I sit in the small but comfortable room where class is being held. I watch as Sherine engages the kids with stories, discussions and a variety of hands-on activities and am amazed at how eagerly these six- to ten-year-olds respond to her teaching. One or two are so enthusiastic that they even attempt to teach me some Urdu. (No easy task.) Soon the lesson is over and it is time to leave. But Sherine insists I first meet her parents. \u201cHow incredible,\u201d I think. \u201cShe is running the camp in her house.\u201d From her parents, I learn that not long ago, Sherine was an eighth-grade dropout whose educational journey seemed to be finished after her father\u2019s unemployment forced her to leave school. Pratham\u2019s Second Chance program, which was free and near her home, made it possible for Sherine to complete her education while also fulfilling her household obligations. They single out one teacher as being particularly inspirational: Parveen Sayyed. A former teen volunteer, Parveen is now head of the Pratham Urdu program, responsible for developing all educational material and programs in Urdu. \u201cShe made it clear to us,\u201d Sherine tells me, \u201cthat we too could do great things if we set our minds to it.\u201d Passing the secondary school exam enabled Sherine to move forward in her education\u2014and beyond expectations\u2014by enrolling in college where she studies Civics, Economics and Commerce. While this is itself an achievement, Sherine went a step further: by deciding to run Pratham\u2019s urban camps in the evening, it is now she who has become the inspiration for others.

Three months ago, Samita was living at home with her aunt, uncle and brother in Shahabaz. She had a twelfth-grade education but no clear direction in life, and she feared marriage might deter any further dreams of education. When a neighbor told her about the Pratham vocational training program in Panvel, Samita jumped at the chance. She enrolled in a three-month electrical course at PACE (Pratham Arora Center for Education), which provided her with classroom instruction and hands-on learning in a growing industry. The 18-year-old admits to a life-long interest in all things technical: studying gadgets, working with her hands, fixing appliances at home. Having the proper training now gives her a chance for a career. Samita is eager to prove herself in the male-dominated electrical field. She understands the inner workings of a light bulb. She can mend a solar street lamp. She is ready to support herself with a job, even if it means moving away from her family. Pratham\u2019s innovative \u201cplace and track\u201d network of coordinators will assist Samita in such a transition, whether it be finding her a place to live or helping her communicate with a new boss. But first, she must get the job.

She gets up at 5:00 am each day to begin her household chores and finish her homework before school starts. She loves math but struggles with reading. Then, one day, she has to leave. Her father, who works as a laborer, moves his entire family to the city for several months, where they work at construction sites hoping to earn enough money to get by for the year.

When Pratham\u2019s Read India program came to her village\u2014in the Lalsot district of Rajasthan\u2014Priyanka was excited. She attended the learning camp held at her school every day. By focusing on Priyanka\u2019s current skill level rather than her age, Pratham was able to help her catch up. Testing showed drastic improvement from the start to the end of the 40-day camp. The hands-on activities added a new level of enjoyment. Priyanka\u2019s\u00a0penchant for math increased, and she even developed an interest in reading. Even though the camp has ended, Priyanka\u2019s rekindled enthusiasm for learning has not.

Both were studying to pass their tenth-grade exam, Kabita after an absence from school of over two decades. Despite their age difference, they shared a special bond: Kabita was Lili\u2019s mother. Then, unexpectedly, Kabita\u2019s husband\u2014Lili\u2019s father\u2014passed away. The two were forced to abandon their studies yet again. Kabita worked extra hours as an ASHA health worker to support the family. Lili took over the duties of housework. When Abhimanyu, a Pratham organizer, visited them to pay his respects, he found them despondent. But with his encouragement, they decided to re-enroll in the Second Chance program the following year and earn their secondary school diplomas. It wouldn\u2019t be easy, but Pratham had rekindled their determination. If Kabita couldn\u2019t attend class because of work, Lili taught her at home from her notes. When things became too hard and Lili wanted to give up, her mother\u2019s words gave her strength: This spring, against many odds, mother and daughter passed their tenth-grade exams.

Two years ago, their father passed away from a heart attack. Their mother, Manjulata, who worked as a domestic help, became the sole breadwinner of the family. Burdened with familial and financial responsibilities, Manjulata constantly worried about Jaga and Balia\u2019s future. Despite the daily travails, Manjulata firmly believed that the education of her children will uplift them from their miseries. She was confident that if her children studied, they would be able to secure jobs with good income. The constraints of their financial situation did dampen her aspirations until the day she discovered Pratham\u2019s \u201cfree\u201d CAMaL Ka Camp, as Manjulata likes to describe it. The CAMaL Ka Camp is a summer camp by Pratham that aims to bridge learning gaps and help children, transitioning from primary to middle school, catch-up on literacy and numeracy skills. With renewed optimism, Manjulata enrolled Jaga and Balia in the summer camp. An initial assessment at the beginning of the camp revealed that Jaga and Balia were struggling to read the most basic of sentences and solve simple division questions. Under the guidance of Pratham\u2019s volunteers, the two boys embarked on a fun learning journey. Every day, they participated in warm-up games like \u201cFire in the Mountain.\" They loved the story activities too, where they could listen and discuss stories with friends. These engaging and simple learning activities sparked a love for learning in Jaga and Balia. As days passed, Jaga and Balia\u2019s confidence bloomed. Within a few weeks, they went from struggling with reading comprehension to reading stories fluently. Even the once-daunting division problems became easy for them to solve. Manjulata didn\u2019t just stand on the sidelines; she was actively involved in the camp, just like her children. She attended classes to learn the camp\u2019s teaching methods. She learnt how to use household objects to teach children at home. The camp made her realize that as a mother she plays a critical role in her sons\u2019 learning journey. \u201cI used to think that I was not capable of supporting my children\u2019s education since I wasn\u2019t educated myself. But Pratham\u2019s summer camp gave me the confidence that I could also make a huge difference in their learning journey. Through the summer camp, I learned how to teach my children basic concepts using simple tools and life experiences,\" Manjulata said. \n\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Us\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Pratham  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBoard  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLeadership  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPartners  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tPrograms\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEducation  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVocational Training   \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnnual Status of Education Report  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPratham Council For Vulnerable Children  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCovid Response  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLearning Readiness & Catch Up  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLessons from the Pandemic  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tGet Involved\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJob Opportunities  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInternships  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tDelhi Office\t\t\t\t\t\t \nB- 4/59, Safdarjung Enclave\n1st Floor, New Delhi - 110 029\nEmail: info@pratham.org\nContact number: 01141651638\n\n\t\t Mumbai Office \nY.B.

Hailing from a small village called Binodpur in West Bengal, she faced economic hardships that forced her to discontinue her education. Her family's financial struggles, with her father working as a farmer and her brothers dropping out of school, made things even harder. But Chintamoni's passion for learning never wavered. She grabbed every opportunity that came her way. In 2022, Chintamoni's life took a significant turn when she became a volunteer teacher at Pratham's CAMaL Ka Camp, a summer catch-up camp supporting children in Grades IV and V to improve their literacy and numeracy skills. She taught children reading, writing, math through guided activities encouraging children to participate and communicate effectively. She got an opportunity to enhance her skills as well. Under Pratham's 'Education For Education' (EFE) initiative, Chintamoni did a Digital Readiness course focusing on digital literacy. In 2023, when the summer camp returned to the village, she once again signed up as a volunteer. This time, Chintamoni went door to door encouraging families to let their children attend the CAMaL Ka Camp. With her determination and persistence, she inspired the local youth to join as volunteers. Having conducted the previous year's camp with great success, she was very confident to pull off all the reading, writing, math activities with ease. Moreover, she looked forward to teaching and interacting with children. This year Chintamoni did Pratham's \u2018Be Internet Awesome\u2019 course. Through the course, she understood more about sharing personal information with care, identifying fraud calls and links, cyberbullying and cyber crime. \u201cI am very happy to get this opportunity to learn about so many useful things through EFE. Such courses are not found easily in rural areas and are also expensive. I found the course very useful and now I will tell my friends and family about it so that everyone can be protected from frauds,\u201d shared Chintamoni. \n\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Us\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Pratham  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBoard  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLeadership  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPartners  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tPrograms\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEducation  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVocational Training   \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnnual Status of Education Report  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPratham Council For Vulnerable Children  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCovid Response  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLearning Readiness & Catch Up  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLessons from the Pandemic  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tGet Involved\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJob Opportunities  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInternships  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tDelhi Office\t\t\t\t\t\t \nB- 4/59, Safdarjung Enclave\n1st Floor, New Delhi - 110 029\nEmail: info@pratham.org\nContact number: 01141651638\n\n\t\t Mumbai Office \nY.B.

When the CAMaL Ka Camp was starting during the summer break, the Pratham team had asked Ragini to join as a volunteer. CAMaL Ka Camp is a summer catch-up camp, supporting children in Grade 4, 5, and 6 to brush up on language and basic math skills before entering middle school. She wasn\u2019t convinced initially that the children needed to improve their learning skills. She, however, changed her mind when she saw that some of the children were unable to read from a Hindi textbook. She decided to support Pratham. After going through the intensive training given to volunteers, Ragini began the camp by reading out stories to children and engaging them. She incorporated a myriad of activities, from singing playful songs to engaging games to solving puzzles, to make learning enjoyable and interactive. However, during her teaching session, she encountered an obstacle: There wasn't a blackboard available to facilitate her teaching. Rather than letting this roadblock hinder her plans, she found a smart solution. After scrounging through her house, she spotted an old iron door sitting forgotten. It may not seem like the typical classroom fixture, yet she saw its potential serving as a blackboard. Discarded fertilizer containers offered the perfect elevation for her makeshift creation. \u201cYou don't need resources, but an intent to bring about change. Children unexpectedly turn up and refuse to leave even after the camp is over. This is the kamaal (amazing) aspect of CAMaL Ka Camp,\" she said. Under Ragini's guidance, the children in her village made remarkable progress in just a few weeks. They could read, solve math problems, and narrate stories. Ragini's friends joined to help manage the growing crowd, and the children saw her as an elder sister, not just a teacher. Ragini's story shows how one person can make a huge impact, even with seemingly small efforts. Small creative improvisations can bring about significant and meaningful change. \n\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Us\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Pratham  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBoard  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLeadership  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPartners  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tPrograms\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEducation  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVocational Training   \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnnual Status of Education Report  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPratham Council For Vulnerable Children  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCovid Response  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLearning Readiness & Catch Up  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLessons from the Pandemic  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tGet Involved\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJob Opportunities  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInternships  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tDelhi Office\t\t\t\t\t\t \nB- 4/59, Safdarjung Enclave\n1st Floor, New Delhi - 110 029\nEmail: info@pratham.org\nContact number: 01141651638\n\n\t\t Mumbai Office \nY.B.

The primary source of income in the village is farming and daily wage labour, with some even working as cobblers and in kilns. Many villagers hold the belief that their children cannot keep pace with the rapidly advancing society and will eventually be limited to agricultural activities. Bulti has been associated with Pratham since 2016. She has a daughter named Trisha, studying in Grade 3, and a son named Subhajit, attending Anganwadi (pre-school). Bulti was determined to support her own children and other youngsters in the community with their learning. Being the only woman in the village who had completed secondary education, Bulti had once aspired to study further and secure a job. Early marriage and household responsibilities put a hold on her dreams. She nurtured a strong desire to provide her children with a good education and support their learning journey. When she was introduced to Pratham and its educational initiatives for children, she was thrilled to find new ways to support the children in her community. When schools closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Bulti assisted the children in her neighborhood with their learning, utilizing the support provided by Pratham through phone calls and messages. Her dedication and commitment inspired other mothers to play an active role in supporting their children\u2019s education at home. During the lockdown, Pratham engaged directly with families of young children (preschool age and those who were of Grade 1 and 2 age). They were sent activities to do with their children via SMS and WhatsApp. Follow-ups were done via phone calls. Young mothers were encouraged to form their own mother-child groups in the neighbourhood and get together regularly to do activities with their children. Bulti played a pivotal role in creating a mother\u2019s group in the village. As the leader of this group, she reads and comprehends all the teaching-learning materials and messages from Pratham, subsequently sharing and demonstrating this knowledge with the other mothers. Bulti also extends her support to these mothers, assisting them in conducting educational activities with their children. Amidst her daily household chores, Bulti prioritizes taking out time for her children\u2019s education and educating other mothers to raise awareness. She strongly believes, \u201cEducation is the only tool that can help us keep up with the present time, and if we work together, our community will not be left behind.\u201d \n\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Us\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Pratham  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBoard  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLeadership  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPartners  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tPrograms\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEducation  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVocational Training   \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnnual Status of Education Report  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPratham Council For Vulnerable Children  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCovid Response  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLearning Readiness & Catch Up  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLessons from the Pandemic  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tGet Involved\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJob Opportunities  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInternships  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tDelhi Office\t\t\t\t\t\t \nB- 4/59, Safdarjung Enclave\n1st Floor, New Delhi - 110 029\nEmail: info@pratham.org\nContact number: 01141651638\n\n\t\t Mumbai Office \nY.B.

It takes a community to educate a child \u2013 and that happens best when the community is excited and engaged with learning. COVID has taught us that instead of children going to school, the school has to come to the child. As part of our effort to build a rich and diverse repository of children\u2019s stories, Pratham has recently entered into a partnership with two well known organizations \u2013 Nayi Dhara and Rekhta. Nishant Baghel and Annapoorni Chandrashekar from Pratham Education Foundation, in collaboration with Rajarshi Singh, PAL Network, published a chapter in the second volume of \u2018Learning at the Bottom of the Pyramid\u2019 by IIEP-UNESCO. Ratri Mukherjee is a Pratham summer camp volunteer in Chatna block of Bankura district. She is a volunteer with a difference.  A visit on day 1 to Haroa, north 24 Parganas  As schools open, teaching should focus primarily on the existing learning abilities of children rather than grade-level curriculum. The pivot from every child in school to every child learning requires a new mind-set Acknowledging that provision of schooling is not translating into improvements in learning is a big step forward. Working actively to find ways to raise learning is another key shift and a welcome change. \n\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Us\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Pratham  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBoard  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLeadership  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPartners  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tPrograms\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEducation  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVocational Training   \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnnual Status of Education Report  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPratham Council For Vulnerable Children  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCovid Response  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLearning Readiness & Catch Up  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLessons from the Pandemic  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tGet Involved\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJob Opportunities  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInternships  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tDelhi Office\t\t\t\t\t\t \nB- 4/59, Safdarjung Enclave\n1st Floor, New Delhi - 110 029\nEmail: info@pratham.org\nContact number: 01141651638\n\n\t\t Mumbai Office \nY.B.

This situation is rooted in and perpetuated by a set of social norms and expectations that frame what is thought of as appropriate behaviours and roles for girls and women. Pratham\u2019s flagship program Second Chance is a year-long intervention which aims to help dropouts, especially girls and women, restart their education and complete secondary schooling. The program provided academic support to learners to help them prepare and appear for Grade 10 examination through Open Schooling Institutions or State Education Boards; learners also get exposure to life skills and similar co-scholastic modules which can enhance their skillset and help in their personal and professional journey. Started in 2011, the program is operational across 12 States in India and has reached more than 40,000 girls and women. The program is headed by a core team which is based across Ahmedabad, Delhi and Mumbai.\nRemote Second Chance (RSCP), an initiative under the Second Chance program, aims to use technology and its advantages to reach out to more interested learners remotely to help them prepare for the board exam. It started in 2019 and is at the stage of scaling up. \nPosition Summary: \nMinimum 2 years commitment required (Can be extended based on performance) Reporting: Second Chance Program Head for Ahmedabad location.\nApplication Process: Send the following to prachi.uikey@pratham.org and mention \u2018Application\u2019 in the subject line. \n\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Us\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Pratham  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBoard  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLeadership  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPartners  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tPrograms\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEducation  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVocational Training   \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnnual Status of Education Report  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPratham Council For Vulnerable Children  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCovid Response  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLearning Readiness & Catch Up  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLessons from the Pandemic  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tGet Involved\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJob Opportunities  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInternships  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tDelhi Office\t\t\t\t\t\t \nB- 4/59, Safdarjung Enclave\n1st Floor, New Delhi - 110 029\nEmail: info@pratham.org\nContact number: 01141651638\n\n\t\t Mumbai Office \nY.B.

Ratri found Pratham! She had heard of Pratham, in the passing, from a teacher at her weekly open university study classes! Ratri was soon to hear about Biplob Mukherjee a Pratham block team member from someone in a neighbouring village, recently. Unable to find Biplob\u2019s coordinates she found him on Facebook and connected. So, when the summer camp was being launched in Chatna, Ratri not only readily agreed to join as a volunteer to teach, (L-R) Rakhi Chakraborty and Ratri Mukherjee She also took it upon herself to help the Pratham team in mobilising volunteers. She insists on monitoring 30 neighbouring villages, also! Her youthful zest for adventure and a scooty to boot, makes her a great fit in our summer camp endeavour in these parts.The class she runs in her village Shaldiha is rather large. Diminutive Rakhi Chakraborty, a graduate in Education, helps Ratri to manage the class. Ratri and Rakhi\u2019s class Chatna block in Bankura is a very large block. 320 villages are spread over 12-gram panchayats. The Pratham team led by Parimal Lohar, and block resource members Moloy Mukherjee, Prasanto Mondal, Ramjan Khan, Deepak Gorait and Shampa Mandi, started mobilising the volunteers almost a month ago. 280 volunteers have been mobilised and trained in 168 villages by the team. 20 more villages will be added this week, and about 40 volunteers have been trained to start the classes. These volunteers are mostly from 10 high schools and Chatna college; 4 panchayats have also helped in mobilising volunteers. Aliva Mondal, Moumita Mondal and Loton Mandi\u2019s class  Aliva Mondal, Moumita Mondal and Loton Mandi of Keshra village, all pursuing a Diploma in Education, have become volunteers because of the panchayat\u2019s assistance, so have Asmita Mondal, a NGO teacher and Barsha Das, a housewife in Metela village.In Kullara village we encounter Gopinath Gorai, Bubai Kalindi and Tinku Singha Babu. While Gopinath and Bubai are high school students, Tinku is an SHG member of the village.One amazing outcome of our team\u2019s mobilization has been such diversity in the volunteers who have joined.

We are outside Sirajuddin Gain\u2019s home in village Purba Bhoyda of Haroa block in North 24 Parganas. Today is the inaugural day of Pratham\u2019s month-long \u2018summer campaign\u2019 across the country. We are here to witness some of the volunteer-led classes in Haroa block. Sirajuddin\u2019s two daughters, Umme Kulsum and Nafsina Parveen have each volunteered to run a class in their home. While Kulsum awaits her high school results, Nafsina is a Std 11 student. Shahida Bibi (extreme right) Rahana Parvin, a Pratham team member explains to the curious lady, the purpose of the congregation. Shahida Bibi promptly demands to know why such a class cannot be held in her home. When Manoj points out she can also volunteer to hold a class like the ones being run by Kulsum and Nafsina, but would she volunteer to teach. She directs her fingers at her granddaughter, Annika Khatun and declares \u2018she will teach\u2019! Annika has completed Std 10, and Rahana will contact her to explore the possibility of starting a class with her. Over the past decade or so, Pratham has experimented with community summer camps, during school summer holidays, in many states, to help improve children\u2019s ability to read and compute basic mathematics which has been worryingly low for 2 decades, as evidenced in ASER surveys. This year, after two years, Pratham has again got an opportunity to resume the exercise. This year\u2019s summer camp gains more significance because the schools were shut for almost 2 years, and in the interim children\u2019s access to learning activities has been limited and variable. Families helped to fill the gap in education while children were at home and teachers tried to send learning materials from remote while schools were closed. Despite the efforts of families, communities and school systems, there is widespread concern about children\u2019s well-being, social-emotional issues, and academic learning loss. The summer camp this year, in West Bengal, attempts to help children of primary school age, who go to Std 4 to 6, to \u201ccatch up\u201d on reading and arithmetic and to build/re-build their foundational skills. This endeavour involves mobilising community volunteers at village, who are trained and provided teaching and learning material (TLM) by Pratham, to teach children daily (barring Sunday) in a community space for an hour or two. In return each youth volunteer can participate in a digital readiness course, to gain the skills to perform a wide range of everyday tasks through digital means. Pratham West Bengal team in Haroa The summer campaign is called \u201cCAMaL ka Camp'' and the approach to engage volunteers is called \u201cEducation for Education\u201d (EfE). Pratham West Bengal currently works in 300 villages, spread across 13 blocks of 12 districts. The focus of the summer camps is to reach out to 1,300 new villages in the catchment area of 13 blocks.The Haroa team comprising Bishwanath Ghosh, who is the district leader and 5 team members Mrinmoy Mandal (Sr), Mrinmoy (Jr), Pradip Das, Sridam Mandal and the relatively newly joined Rahana Parvin, who was earlier a Pratham library volunteer have managed to mobilize volunteers in every new village in Haroa, numbering 75! This was of course made possible because till 2017 Pratham ran a library programme in more than 50 villages of Haroa, and the linkages made then with the panchayat, schoolteachers, community members, other NGOs working in the area by them helped! Shabana Khatun is also one such Pratham library volunteer whose class we visit today, in village Ramnathpur. Her class, like every other class we visited, has children who are in Std 1 to 3 as well! They cannot be stopped; they also wish to learn. We certainly have to think about this scenario. Quite honestly, one month is not enough to get them to catch up. Sharmina Khatun, a university graduate also from Purba Bhoyda tells us, \u2018I have joined this campaign because our children were deprived of education during the Covid-19 lockdown, and it is our duty to ensure they do not suffer. Sharmina runs a class with 2 other sisters, Taj and Apruja Khatun. The 1st day of summer camp has clearly created a buzz amongst children, community and the volunteers! We are confident that the activities will have a positive impact on both the children and the community in the next one month. We also need to think about how to sustain the gains in the next one month. \n\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Us\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Pratham  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBoard  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLeadership  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPartners  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tPrograms\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEducation  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVocational Training   \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnnual Status of Education Report  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPratham Council For Vulnerable Children  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCovid Response  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLearning Readiness & Catch Up  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLessons from the Pandemic  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tGet Involved\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJob Opportunities  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInternships  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tDelhi Office\t\t\t\t\t\t \nB- 4/59, Safdarjung Enclave\n1st Floor, New Delhi - 110 029\nEmail: info@pratham.org\nContact number: 01141651638\n\n\t\t Mumbai Office \nY.B.

New Directions.  \u2013 Pratham", "content": "After almost twenty-two months of coping with the pandemic, as we step into the new year, three perspectives seem to have emerged about school education. (Let us see whether the current Omicron wave changes these views or not.) According to the first point of view, when schools open and children are back in school, normal and usual school practices should be re-established. Teachers pick up textbooks for each grade and each subject; teaching-learning is anchored, as it was before COVID, to grade level curricular expectations. Examinations and assessments move ahead, pretty much like before. This school of thought accepts that although the pandemic brought in its wake, tremendous trouble and turmoil, when these difficulties recede, \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d can prevail. The second perspective is held by those who feel that the pandemic has pushed us back in history. For ten years, pre-COVID, more than 96% of children of elementary school age were enrolled in school. Universal enrollment had practically been achieved. But now, after more than 600 days of school closure, the progress of the last decade may be in jeopardy. There is a high possibility of school drop-out. Among those for whom economic disruption was the hardest, children may not re-enroll in school. Families who were economically week and educationally disadvantaged have been the hardest hit. Proponents of the third approach accept that the combined effect of the pandemic and of school closures has been devastating and the country will take time to recover. But they also believe that the prolonged, unprecedented situation led to experimentation and innovation. New methods were tried, new skills have been acquired, new lessons have been learned. New people have come into the picture. To strengthen the future of our children, these new learnings and experiences must be integrated into future plans. Dear reader, which of these pathways are you aligned with? Do you think the train had stopped and now it has restarted, carrying passengers forward on their journey \u2013 just the way it used to do before? Or do you believe that the train has fallen off the tracks, passengers have been hurt \u2013 we need to nurse them back to health, get the train back on the tracks and then the journey can be resumed again. Or do you think that the journey has changed completely? It is essential to reflect and make sense of the last two years. We need to do this in our families, in our communities and at state and national levels too. Heads and hearts have to be used for understanding what has just happened and for linking it to what can be done for the future. Our hands will do what our heads tell us and hearts inspire us to do. The first perspective encourages teachers to pick up textbooks and start where they had left off. The second group is busy listening to parents and their troubles and helping children cope with the situation \u2013 all of this is part of bringing children back to school. The third team is looking at schooling and learning, goals and practices in a new light. Dealing with the pandemic has made them completely rethink the \u201cwhy\u201d, \u201cwhat\u201d, \u201cwhen\u201d, \u201cwhere\u201d, \u201cwho\u201d and \u201chow\u201d of education and come up with new solutions.

New people have come into the picture. To strengthen the future of our children, these new learnings and experiences must be integrated into future plans. Dear reader, which of these pathways are you aligned with? Do you think the train had stopped and now it has restarted, carrying passengers forward on their journey \u2013 just the way it used to do before? Or do you believe that the train has fallen off the tracks, passengers have been hurt \u2013 we need to nurse them back to health, get the train back on the tracks and then the journey can be resumed again. Or do you think that the journey has changed completely? It is essential to reflect and make sense of the last two years. We need to do this in our families, in our communities and at state and national levels too. Heads and hearts have to be used for understanding what has just happened and for linking it to what can be done for the future. Our hands will do what our heads tell us and hearts inspire us to do. The first perspective encourages teachers to pick up textbooks and start where they had left off. The second group is busy listening to parents and their troubles and helping children cope with the situation \u2013 all of this is part of bringing children back to school. The third team is looking at schooling and learning, goals and practices in a new light. Dealing with the pandemic has made them completely rethink the \u201cwhy\u201d, \u201cwhat\u201d, \u201cwhen\u201d, \u201cwhere\u201d, \u201cwho\u201d and \u201chow\u201d of education and come up with new solutions.

Over the last 27 years, Pratham has grown to be one of the largest non-profit organizations working to provide quality education to children and youth in over 20 states and union territories across the country, through a range of interventions.Pratham is a widely recognized organization, having received notable awards such as the Yidan Prize, Lui Che Woo Prize, WISE Prize for Innovation, Skoll Award for Social Entrepreneurship, the Henry R Kravis Prize in Leadership, and the CNN-IBN Indian of the Year for Public Service. For more details, refer to www.pratham.org .About the ENABLE ProgramThe National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 emphasizes the fundamental importance of universal foundational literacy and numeracy (FLN). The policy asserts that all other aspects are relevant only if children acquire these essential skills during primary school. Children, especially those with special needs and disabilities, face significant barriers hindering their acquisition of foundational skills. In India, an estimated 7.8 million children and young individuals had disabilities in 2019. Alarmingly, a large proportion of them do not attend educational institutions, and 45% struggle to attain foundational literacy. Urgent, concerted efforts and inclusive education initiatives are vital to help these children overcome obstacles, fostering their full potential. Fortunately, existing policy frameworks, technological advancements, and governmental commitment offer a unique opportunity to address this pressing need. ENABLE' or 'Equity in Accessing Numeracy And Basic Literacy Education', is a multi-pronged intervention to strengthen the quality of education for 3-9 year olds with disabilities.ENABLE promotesIt is about time, mainstream education becomes \u201cinclusive\u201d in all dimensions\u201cChildren first\u201d approach Position Summary:Program Manager plays a pivotal role in project planning, execution, coordination, monitoring, and reporting.

For more details, refer to www.pratham.org .About the ENABLE ProgramThe National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 emphasizes the fundamental importance of universal foundational literacy and numeracy (FLN). The policy asserts that all other aspects are relevant only if children acquire these essential skills during primary school. Children, especially those with special needs and disabilities, face significant barriers hindering their acquisition of foundational skills. In India, an estimated 7.8 million children and young individuals had disabilities in 2019. Alarmingly, a large proportion of them do not attend educational institutions, and 45% struggle to attain foundational literacy. Urgent, concerted efforts and inclusive education initiatives are vital to help these children overcome obstacles, fostering their full potential. Fortunately, existing policy frameworks, technological advancements, and governmental commitment offer a unique opportunity to address this pressing need.

To reduce some of the anxieties that this unprecedented crisis has brought with it, Pratham is reaching out to its little friends \u2013 children and parents in our early childhood programs. We find that even in a difficult time like this, everyone likes being connected and many are talking to us continuously even while stuck at home. Here is a sneak peek into some of Pratham\u2019s experiences and stories of staying in touch with children and families in our early childhood education programs. Parents and children are spending more time together in this lockdown than they used to when regular routines and daily schedules were in place. The lockdown time has been a unique opportunity for parents and children to establish strong bonds and help build developmental abilities through play and fun! To reach out to all our different communities in this time, Pratham is leveraging its extensive repository of stories, rhymes, activities, and games, which are reaching parents \u2013 through their mobile phones in the language of their choice. This content is accessible here. Parents with smartphones can easily access such digital content, but it is equally important to engage parents who have basic phones. And so, in a matter of days, we developed SMS content across 8 different languages. These SMS (short messaging service) messages conveyed short and simple, yet effective messages such as a simple rhyme, an activity, or a story. Together, with the WhatsApp and SMS content, we began reaching out to families of the children that we have closely worked with over the years. Every day, one WhatsApp and one SMS message are being sent to these families.    Put different things in a bag. Close your eyes. Put your hand in the bag. Touch and say what you find.   The activities were designed in such way that parents would not have to step out of the house for any extra material. Household objects and materials, such as simple paper, buttons, boxes, cups, plates, fruits, and vegetables \u2013 serve as support to the parents as they engage with children in a variety of fun activities. It quickly became clear that mothers were at the forefront of ensuring that the messages were being translated into activities with children. Fathers, older siblings and grandparents did not want to be left behind \u2013 and we saw them actively supporting children as they made butterflies from paper which could fly, learnt and recited songs and rhymes, and played with patterns and shapes. Every day, parents enthusiastically share photos and videos of their children participating in a range of learning and play activities. To support the message sharing process, Pratham team members also began calling parents regularly (especially those parents who had simple phones) to help them understand the activities and processes with ease, and take feedback on how children were responding and whether the activity was simple enough to execute (here is a sample audio of our follow up conversations with parents). Now the activities have become a part of parents\u2019 and children\u2019s daily lives, and the photos and videos that are received everyday have become the high point for the Pratham team. Pratham\u2019s early childhood campaign reaches families of about 2,500+ communities across 15 states of India every day. Here is a snapshot of what we are sending to parents: A song on mangoes | Make your own butterfly | Let\u2019s hear a Story | Learning about Plants In return, they send glimpses of what they did, back to us!\n Shopkeepers for a Day | Facial Expressions | Playing with Patterns | Having fun with Rhymes            All our learning resources are available in 11 languages for free and can be accessed through the PraDigi App or by visiting our website prathamopenschool.org. Videos have been made available on Pratham Open School YouTube channels as well. Collaborations specific to the needs of the state government are also developing \u2013 for example, Pratham is sharing learning content through government teachers in the states of Punjab and Himachal Pradesh. Pratham is also sharing learning activities via radio in Nagpur district of Maharashtra. This video is an example of pre-primary children learning during school shut down. And this audio provides a glimpse into the radio show in Nagpur! The past few months have been a journey of immense learning for the Pratham team, as we discovered the power of technology to sustain play even in uncertain and locked down environments. It has added new and unique dimensions to how we think about our engagement with children and families. Here is hoping for many more adventures with our communities as we all try and get through these trying times together!

To reduce some of the anxieties that this unprecedented crisis has brought with it, Pratham is reaching out to its little friends \u2013 children and parents in our early childhood programs. We find that even in a difficult time like this, everyone likes being connected and many are talking to us continuously even while stuck at home. Here is a sneak peek into some of Pratham\u2019s experiences and stories of staying in touch with children and families in our early childhood education programs. Parents and children are spending more time together in this lockdown than they used to when regular routines and daily schedules were in place. The lockdown time has been a unique opportunity for parents and children to establish strong bonds and help build developmental abilities through play and fun! To reach out to all our different communities in this time, Pratham is leveraging its extensive repository of stories, rhymes, activities, and games, which are reaching parents \u2013 through their mobile phones in the language of their choice. This content is accessible here. Parents with smartphones can easily access such digital content, but it is equally important to engage parents who have basic phones. And so, in a matter of days, we developed SMS content across 8 different languages. These SMS (short messaging service) messages conveyed short and simple, yet effective messages such as a simple rhyme, an activity, or a story. Together, with the WhatsApp and SMS content, we began reaching out to families of the children that we have closely worked with over the years. Every day, one WhatsApp and one SMS message are being sent to these families.    Put different things in a bag. Close your eyes. Put your hand in the bag. Touch and say what you find.   The activities were designed in such way that parents would not have to step out of the house for any extra material. Household objects and materials, such as simple paper, buttons, boxes, cups, plates, fruits, and vegetables \u2013 serve as support to the parents as they engage with children in a variety of fun activities. It quickly became clear that mothers were at the forefront of ensuring that the messages were being translated into activities with children. Fathers, older siblings and grandparents did not want to be left behind \u2013 and we saw them actively supporting children as they made butterflies from paper which could fly, learnt and recited songs and rhymes, and played with patterns and shapes. Every day, parents enthusiastically share photos and videos of their children participating in a range of learning and play activities. To support the message sharing process, Pratham team members also began calling parents regularly (especially those parents who had simple phones) to help them understand the activities and processes with ease, and take feedback on how children were responding and whether the activity was simple enough to execute (here is a sample audio of our follow up conversations with parents). Now the activities have become a part of parents\u2019 and children\u2019s daily lives, and the photos and videos that are received everyday have become the high point for the Pratham team. Pratham\u2019s early childhood campaign reaches families of about 2,500+ communities across 15 states of India every day. Here is a snapshot of what we are sending to parents: A song on mangoes | Make your own butterfly | Let\u2019s hear a Story | Learning about Plants In return, they send glimpses of what they did, back to us!\n Shopkeepers for a Day | Facial Expressions | Playing with Patterns | Having fun with Rhymes            All our learning resources are available in 11 languages for free and can be accessed through the PraDigi App or by visiting our website prathamopenschool.org. Videos have been made available on Pratham Open School YouTube channels as well. Collaborations specific to the needs of the state government are also developing \u2013 for example, Pratham is sharing learning content through government teachers in the states of Punjab and Himachal Pradesh. Pratham is also sharing learning activities via radio in Nagpur district of Maharashtra. This video is an example of pre-primary children learning during school shut down. And this audio provides a glimpse into the radio show in Nagpur! The past few months have been a journey of immense learning for the Pratham team, as we discovered the power of technology to sustain play even in uncertain and locked down environments. It has added new and unique dimensions to how we think about our engagement with children and families. Here is hoping for many more adventures with our communities as we all try and get through these trying times together!

Malls and shops, gated communities, fancy buildings and marriage gardens are soon left behind. All around us are fields of golden green ripening rice waiting to be harvested. Darker green trees, big and small, border the fields. Hills and rocky outcrops look down from their height. Boulders balancing precariously one on top of the other as if someone has dropped them carefully from above. The sky is light and blue with a gentle breeze, so typical of the weather between Dussehra and Diwali. It is a perfect day.  We leave the highway. The rough road winds through shrubs and farmlands to arrive in a small village. In the centre of the village is the school compound. The walls are low.\u00a0 For an adult it is easy to look in. It is a typical government primary school building \u2013 two or three rooms and a veranda in front. The signboard says the school was established in 1964. The compound is very large. There are neatly planted flowerbeds around the actual building.\u00a0 Three large trees have spread their branches like arms to cover almost the entire playground with a lacy shade and filigree shadows.\u00a0 Even in the hottest summers, children can play outside happily. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Schools opened in Chhattisgarh a few months ago. We are in Kanker district and in our school today, the younger ones \u2013 Class 1 and 2 are together. A math lesson is going on. Girls and boys are sitting on long, folded dhurrie strips. In front of each child there is a small pile of stones and a grid drawn with chalk on the floor. The teacher gives them a problem \u2013 5+3 or 6+2 and so on. Children count the stones \u2013 you can hear the murmuring as they count. Then the child writes the answer in the grid. As the teacher walks around the room she can easily see what the children are doing and who needs a bit of support.\u00a0 Sometimes friends lean over and help each other too.\u00a0 The air in the classroom is calm and confident.  We decide to go out. Quickly, children stream into the courtyard. Voices outside are much louder, calling to each other with joy and in fun. On the wide cemented chabutara or platform around the base of the biggest tree there is a lot of space to sit as a group and even to put a blackboard on it. \u00a0We play some number games. Then comes a demand for a story.\u00a0 I start with one of my favourites \u2013 \u201cMaaloo, Kaaloo and Aaloo\u201d. \u201cMaaloo is a little boy. His Nani wants him to go outside and bring some aaloo (potato). So, he takes his friend Kaaloo along.\u00a0 Kaaloo has four legs, two ears and a tail. Who do you think he is?\u201d I ask. Instantly, the children say \u201cbhaaloo\u201d (bear). (I am surprised with their answer but later on that day we hear in a village near by that bears are very common in the area. So, it turns out that the childrens\u2019 answer was not surprising at all.)\u00a0 The story moves along. Maaloo and Kaaloo hunt till the potatoes are found. \u201cWhat about pictures?\u201d I want to know.\u00a0 Children race back into the classroom. Within minutes, they come racing out with and shapes, Maaloo is in the pictures too. In one of the drawings there is a black dog with sharp ears and a pointy tail. It is time for the midday meal. Big steel thalis (plates) come out. Children run to the tap near the boundary wall to wash them. \u201cRemember to scrub your hands well\u201d they shout to each other.\u00a0 The school teachers ask us to stay and have lunch with the children. But we have to leave. The happy sounds of children in school stay with us long into the day.   Much later in the afternoon, well after school is done, we make our way to an interior village. More than half an hour off the main road, driving through sun soaked fields and sleepy forests we reach our destination. The village is quite spread out, several mohallas and hamlets. Although it is not yet dusk, cattle are returning home at a leisurely pace.\u00a0 Preparations for Diwali are well underway. Houses have been freshly painted often in bright colours. Drawings on the outer walls seem recent.\u00a0 In an open space next to a one room building, there is a group of children sitting on the floor around a young woman. Bags are open, books and notebooks spill out and are open, pencils, pens, rulers everywhere. Clearly, they have been working together for a while. Two grandmothers are sitting on the edge of the circle \u2013 one in an orange sari and another in green. They are very well known as story tellers. One tells traditional stories and the other modern ones. The two have been friends for ages. The discussion naturally moves to the topic of school closures and the pandemic. \u201cIt is only these mohalla groups that has kept children connected to their studies\u201d says one grandmother.\u00a0 In every neighbourhood, there are groups like the one in front of us. College or high school students help their younger siblings and neighbours. Sometimes they too have been members of a children\u2019s group in the past.  For the youngest children, this year the situation is tough. Those who are in Class 1 or 2 today have never been to school before or in fact to pre-school either. Everything has been closed for over a year and a half. To support the youngest children, mothers\u2019 groups have been formed in the village.\u00a0 An activity is sent everyday via a phone message (WhatsApp or SMS) to mothers directly. Once a week under the guidance of a group leader \u2013 \u201cSmartMata\u201d (smart mother \u2013 someone who has a smart phone), the groups gets together to discuss what they have been doing as well as the activities for the next week.\u00a0 Mothers\u2019 groups were not hard to organize in this village.\u00a0 There seems to be an active women\u2019s self-help group movement here too.\u00a0 Most women have children at home and so helping them seemed a natural extension of the group\u2019s agenda. Now it is dark. We have visited almost every mohalla group. In some places, they meet on the veranda and in other places in someone\u2019s house. Everywhere, even in the dim light, you can see shining eyes, enthusiastic groups of children, their proud volunteers and mothers. \u00a0Our orange sari grandmother invites us to her house. She has a Diwali gift for us \u2013 a \u201cjhoomar\u201d \u2013 a hanging mini chandelier made of rice husk. \u201cTake it home\u201d, she says. \u201cHang it where the birds can come and eat the grain\u201d. We make our way back through the dark forest. Above, the sky is glittering with stars like jewels overflowing from an upturned jewellery box.\u00a0 It truly has been a perfect day.  Rukmini Banerji.

The heavy traffic which we encountered leaving Kolkata, continues right through our journey. Even the highway is choked, caused by the traffic lights that have been erected.\u00a0 This 8-lane highway was constructed to ease long distance travel and follows a path away from the many small towns that sprang up along the mighty Ganges, a flourishing maritime trade route since medieval times, that has footprints of the Portuguese, French, German, Danes, Dutch and of course the British! This relatively new highway is the gateway to the North of the country and has replaced the famed Grand Trunk (GT) Road, said to have been constructed by the Afghan ruler, Sher Shah Suri, that went right up to Peshawar, touching all major North Indian cities. An ever-increasing population, and lack of earning opportunities have forced an extension of these small towns right upto the new highway and has necessitated the creation of cross-traffic corridors. Our planners, not known for their foresight, really should have constructed flyovers over these spots. The large potholes created by the rains, at these junctions does not help matters. We were on our way from our Kolkata office to Siuri the district headquarters of district Birbhum in West Bengal. We have done this stretch in 4 hours many times. We hoped to reach Sriniketan Block, 35 kms before Siuri, by 4 in the afternoon, well in time to see our volunteer led evening classes. The road to Siuri breaks off from the national highway just before Barddhaman. Coming from Kolkata we make a right U-turn into the service lane and turn left to reach the mouth of 2-lane state highway, which was in a fairly good condition. No potholes on these roads. We have travelled about 120 kms from our office and it has taken us almost 3 and a half hours, much more than our usual 2 hours. From this point on we were hoping to reach Sriniketan Block in one hour or so. This road, though very busy, has a flowing traffic, but overtaking is not possible if another vehicle comes from the opposite end. One only slows down when passing through a village. There are a few. Alas, our bad luck continued. The traffic from opposite end was sparse for a few kms, mainly cars with an occasional cargo laden truck, till we reached a railway crossing. This rail track connects Kolkata to North India and is very busy. The rail gate must have been closed for a while because there were a number of vehicles in front of us. Traffic was allowed to move after a 20 \u2013 minute wait, but the chaos created at the mouth of the rail gate by cars coming from the wrong side, and multitude of 2-wheelers on either side vying to cross the rail gate first led to a huge traffic snarl. After 30 minutes of intense manoeuvring our driver managed to cross the rail gate.  After crossing the railway tracks, we saw what the main problem was. It was the enormous number of cargo laden trucks and trailers which was the cause of this snarl! The entire traffic from North Bengal had been diverted from the main highway to this narrow state highway. We crawled past hundreds of trucks who had blocked one side of the road. In effect what had happened was a 2-way traffic of cars, buses, 2-wheelers, and an occasional tractor, was moving on just one lane. Cyclists, pedestrians and animals also staked their claim to be part of this mess! It takes us almost 2 hours to leave this chaos behind. \u00a0We were way behind schedule. Not much distance was covered in those 2 hours. Visiting our volunteer led classes in Sriniketan was definitely not possible this afternoon. The golden glow of a mellow setting autumnal sun over the lush green paddy looked spectacular! At this time of the year most parts of rural West Bengal hold the same spectacle. We soon crossed river Ajoy. Early autumn is also the time when Saccharum Spontaneum or Kans grass, Kash in Bangla are in full bloom. The distinctive dense white bloom, flanking the banks of Ajoy had also turned golden! The effects of the setting sun.   We reached Siuri just before 7 pm. Today, our schedule will be tight. We will visit as many Pratham volunteer led classes as possible in the morning, in the villages Sriniketan block. Sriniketan adjoins the famous Vishwabharati University in Shantiniketan set up by the Nobel Laureate Rabindranath Tagore. In the afternoon, it will be to witness the Self Help Group mother run classes mobilized by Liver Foundation, in Nagari block. Siuri is situated to the north of Shantiniketan. The 35 kms distance between the 2 towns is about an hour\u2019s drive. Mahaprasad one of Pratham\u2019s block leaders in West Bengal, who has recently been moved to Nagari block to supervise our partnership programme with Liver Foundation in a cluster of 23 villages, meets us at the guest house where we had spent the night. We are soon on our way to collect one of our Cluster leaders of Sriniketan, Basudeb who would be our guide this morning, from Shantiniketan. We reach Shantiniketan at 7:30 pm and stop at a popular roadside shack to eat breakfast. A type of potato fritters and puffed rice is a popular snacks in these parts. Basudeb soon joins us, and we eat just the fritters and drink black tea. This should sustain us at least till lunch time. Breakfast for 5 of us was just Rs 75 (about one USD)!  Rural Bengal is still very reasonable. Lohagorh village is the first village we visit. It is one of the 25 cluster of villages in Sriniketan block where Pratham implements its volunteer based Hamara Gaon programme. Covid19 has made us alter our strategy. Since the beginning of August this year we have started 2 programmes, \u2018Readiness\u2019 directed at children in Grades 1 and 2 and \u2019Catch-up\u2019 for Grade 3 and above.   \u2018Catch-up\u2019 has a reading and a mathematics component. Each day an hour-long class is held in the community by a Pratham volunteer. Due to Covid-19 we also try to ensure that the class size remains small and hold multiple classes in a village. Some in the morning and some in the evening. About 8 children ranging from Std 1 to 4 are present in volunteer Nasima Khatun\u2019s class. 4 of them in Std 1 & 2 and 4 in Std 3 & 4. The Std 3 & 4 children have just started the reading component of the \u2018Catch-up\u2019 package after a month-long mathematics classes. None of the younger children can read! The children enrolled in Std 1 and 2 have never attended school due to Covid19. The ones in Std 3 and 4 can just about read. These physical volunteer led classes have started after a break of almost 15 months, Nasima Khatun who has been trained virtually to administer the \u2018Readiness\u2019 and \u2018Catch-up packages is yet to come to terms on how to deal with the situation. Our Cluster leaders will have to provide her more classroom support in the days to come. We are, however, extremely surprised at the interest the books have generated amongst the younger children! Though they cannot yet read, they seem absolutely mesmerized by the books and hardly pay us any attention. Dakshin Harirampur is a tribal majority village, where most villagers work as labourers. Menoka Murmu, though an old Pratham volunteer, is a replacement teacher for the time being for Sumitra Murmu. She is handling a diverse range of children from Std 1 to 8 well. But, when we start communicating with the children directly, she actually has to translate our words in Alchiki \u2013 a tribal language spoken in these parts, to particularly the younger children.    The children then answer us in Bangla! The older children in this group were more or less fluent readers of Bangla. Basudeb and Mahaprasad reorganize the group of 21 into 4 groups, with at least one fluent reader in each group. We also meet a mother\u2019s group in Dakshin Harirampur. Most work as daily wage labourers. We try quizzing them on their thoughts on education, particularly in these troubled times.  They hardly spoke at first, only nodding their head. It takes just one mother to break the shackles, then all of them get engaged in animated conversation. They are worried about their children\u2019s education; some even sent their children to private tuition during the lockdown when our community classes were not running. They want the schools to reopen soon. Benuria village is the last village we manage this morning. Volunteer Sucharita only has 8 children in her class. All girls from Std 3 to 6. While the two Std 6 children could read Bangla story fluently. The rest could not. The Std 3 & 4 children were still at word level. The \u2018Catch-up\u2019 reading component has just started here, hopefully in a month\u2019s time all 8 will be able to read fluently. The schools in Bengal will perhaps open after Diwali. These children must be equipped to at least follow what is happening in the class. Clearly the children in Std 1 to 4 are the worst hit! Our team is trying their best to get these children into shape.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Us\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Pratham  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBoard  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLeadership  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPartners  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tPrograms\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEducation  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVocational Training   \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnnual Status of Education Report  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPratham Council For Vulnerable Children  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCovid Response  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLearning Readiness & Catch Up  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLessons from the Pandemic  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tGet Involved\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJob Opportunities  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInternships  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tDelhi Office\t\t\t\t\t\t \nB- 4/59, Safdarjung Enclave\n1st Floor, New Delhi - 110 029\nEmail: info@pratham.org\nContact number: 01141651638\n\n\t\t Mumbai Office \nY.B.

Manoj and I are on our way to Haroa block of North 24 Parganas, where we run the Hamara Gaon programme in a cluster of 25 villages with support of local volunteers. It was in this very district where Pratham started its first major programme in the state of West Bengal in 2007, when in partnership with the district administration Read India was launched in Sandeshkhali block. The programme was soon to spread across the district driven by the district administration. Quite a few of the current Pratham team members in West Bengal are from this district, having joined us back in 2007.\u00a0 We have started early because the volunteer-led community classes are likely to begin at 8 am in the morning and will typically last an hour. We want to witness as many classroom activities as possible within the hour. Classes are also held in the evening, but we cannot stay back to see them. The journey which is supposed to take 2 hours actually takes us just over an hour! We are in Haroa town after a 70-minute drive from our office in Salt Lake. Pradeep Das, one of our local team members, joins us at the bus depot, our rendezvous. Like in most Pratham Hamara Gaon locations, the Haroa block team also comprises 6-members. They all live in the block office not far from the bus depot. All of them have returned to the block after a long break caused by Covid19. The field is gradually opening up. Physical visits to some villages are now possible. Covid19 has also made us rethink our strategy. Schools have shut down from February last year, and only now slowly starting to reopen. Needless to mention primary education is probably one of the worst hit areas in our education system. When schools reopen, the children will perhaps be expected to follow grade level textbooks, unmindful of entire cohorts might have proceeded to Grade 2 and 3 without attending classes; the higher-grade children, like those in grades 4, 5 and 6 whose levels of foundational literacy anyway has been found wanting over the years, would also perhaps be taught from textbooks they are unable to comprehend. Under the circumstances even our strategy cannot be business as usual. We have tried various innovations to keep in touch with the children, parents, community members, teachers etc during the lockdown. We have employed a mixture of WhatsApp and SMS message-based activities and also our local village volunteers to maintain these contacts. Since the beginning of August this year we have started 2 programmes, \u2018Readiness\u2019 directed at children in Grades 1 and 2 and \u2019Catch-up\u2019 for Grade 3 and above. We are in Haroa to witness the effect of these. This trip also happens to be my first field visit to witness Pratham activities since February 2020! And also, my visit to this district after 14 long years! The cluster of 25 villages where we work is dotted with many fish farms called \u2018Bheri\u2019 in colloquial Bangla. Massive expanses of water, with perhaps a little more than a knee-deep water, makes them more fearful than they perhaps actually are. Fishing, together with agriculture are the mainstay of the local economy. We visit 3 villages with our local team members, Pradip Das, Mrinmay Mandal and Sridam Mandal. First to Makalgachi, followed by Dakshin Ranigachi and Uttar Ranigachi. In that hourlong window we get to see \u2018Catch-up\u2019 classroom activities supervised by volunteers, Kanchandeb Lohara, Mallika Lohara, Bandana Lohara, Dipti Roy and Minu Khatun. Volunteer Kanchandeb Lohara\u2019s class Volunteer Mallika Lohara\u2019s class We meet Anima Lohara, an ICDS teacher in village Makalgachi, who helps us spread the \u2018Readiness\u2019 package amongst the mothers to conduct activities with their respective children in Grades 1 and 2. We also attend a mother\u2019s group meeting in village Uttar Ranigachi. Almost 30 mothers were present including Shampa Roy, an ICDS worker, and Rebeka Bibi, a \u2018smart\u2019 mother! A \u2018smart\u2019 mother coined by our team members is a mother with an android phone, who receives our \u2018Readiness\u2019 package. She then mobilises mothers with children in Grade 1 and 2 and distributes the package amongst them and holds weekly meetings with them to discuss the progress made by their children and any problems they might face to use the \u2018Readiness\u2019 package and suggest solutions. Some common patterns are witnessed in these volunteer-led \u2018Catch-up\u2019 classes. They are being held in each \u2018para\u2019 or \u2018mohalla\u2019 with not more than 10 children in each. The children range from Grade 3 to 6. Social distancing norms were by and large followed in all classes.   But the most interesting part of our visit is, in every class we visit the children are so focussed on what is being taught that they choose to ignore our presence. An ideal situation really! But this is the first time I am witnessing anything like this. They acknowledge our presence only when the teacher directs her attention to us and promptly switches to her the moment she starts teaching again.  Volunteer Dipti Roy Even the most restless child, who we later realise is extremely intelligent, is actually looking in the general direction of the teacher and continuously fidgeting!  Both the teacher and we think he is not paying any attention, but he answers all questions asked of him and gives the most intelligent answers when we ask him questions, very animatedly.  Is it the pandemic which has made them so focussed or is it the proximity to Kolkata, perhaps they are more likely to meet people like us, I wonder? The volunteers clearly have a great rapport with the children, they know the names of each child in their respective classrooms. The mother\u2019s group we meet are equally enthusiastic about these classes. They clearly understand the value of these classes in these troubled times when the schools are shut. They are practically unanimous in their demand for more supplementary reading material for the children. Bandana Lohara, is one of the \u2018Readiness\u2019 package contacts. Here she is seen displaying her various science models that she has created with the children. Bandana has been with us as a library group leader since 2016. The dark clouds of a retreating monsoon and ominous rumbling sounds of an imminent storm hasten our departure from Haroa! But not before we encounter a party of frolicking villagers, on our way out.

Manoj and I are on our way to Haroa block of North 24 Parganas, where we run the Hamara Gaon programme in a cluster of 25 villages with support of local volunteers. It was in this very district where Pratham started its first major programme in the state of West Bengal in 2007, when in partnership with the district administration Read India was launched in Sandeshkhali block. The programme was soon to spread across the district driven by the district administration. Quite a few of the current Pratham team members in West Bengal are from this district, having joined us back in 2007.\u00a0 We have started early because the volunteer-led community classes are likely to begin at 8 am in the morning and will typically last an hour. We want to witness as many classroom activities as possible within the hour. Classes are also held in the evening, but we cannot stay back to see them. The journey which is supposed to take 2 hours actually takes us just over an hour! We are in Haroa town after a 70-minute drive from our office in Salt Lake. Pradeep Das, one of our local team members, joins us at the bus depot, our rendezvous. Like in most Pratham Hamara Gaon locations, the Haroa block team also comprises 6-members. They all live in the block office not far from the bus depot. All of them have returned to the block after a long break caused by Covid19. The field is gradually opening up. Physical visits to some villages are now possible. Covid19 has also made us rethink our strategy. Schools have shut down from February last year, and only now slowly starting to reopen. Needless to mention primary education is probably one of the worst hit areas in our education system. When schools reopen, the children will perhaps be expected to follow grade level textbooks, unmindful of entire cohorts might have proceeded to Grade 2 and 3 without attending classes; the higher-grade children, like those in grades 4, 5 and 6 whose levels of foundational literacy anyway has been found wanting over the years, would also perhaps be taught from textbooks they are unable to comprehend. Under the circumstances even our strategy cannot be business as usual. We have tried various innovations to keep in touch with the children, parents, community members, teachers etc during the lockdown. We have employed a mixture of WhatsApp and SMS message-based activities and also our local village volunteers to maintain these contacts. Since the beginning of August this year we have started 2 programmes, \u2018Readiness\u2019 directed at children in Grades 1 and 2 and \u2019Catch-up\u2019 for Grade 3 and above. We are in Haroa to witness the effect of these. This trip also happens to be my first field visit to witness Pratham activities since February 2020! And also, my visit to this district after 14 long years! The cluster of 25 villages where we work is dotted with many fish farms called \u2018Bheri\u2019 in colloquial Bangla. Massive expanses of water, with perhaps a little more than a knee-deep water, makes them more fearful than they perhaps actually are. Fishing, together with agriculture are the mainstay of the local economy. We visit 3 villages with our local team members, Pradip Das, Mrinmay Mandal and Sridam Mandal. First to Makalgachi, followed by Dakshin Ranigachi and Uttar Ranigachi. In that hourlong window we get to see \u2018Catch-up\u2019 classroom activities supervised by volunteers, Kanchandeb Lohara, Mallika Lohara, Bandana Lohara, Dipti Roy and Minu Khatun. Volunteer Kanchandeb Lohara\u2019s class Volunteer Mallika Lohara\u2019s class We meet Anima Lohara, an ICDS teacher in village Makalgachi, who helps us spread the \u2018Readiness\u2019 package amongst the mothers to conduct activities with their respective children in Grades 1 and 2. We also attend a mother\u2019s group meeting in village Uttar Ranigachi. Almost 30 mothers were present including Shampa Roy, an ICDS worker, and Rebeka Bibi, a \u2018smart\u2019 mother! A \u2018smart\u2019 mother coined by our team members is a mother with an android phone, who receives our \u2018Readiness\u2019 package. She then mobilises mothers with children in Grade 1 and 2 and distributes the package amongst them and holds weekly meetings with them to discuss the progress made by their children and any problems they might face to use the \u2018Readiness\u2019 package and suggest solutions. Some common patterns are witnessed in these volunteer-led \u2018Catch-up\u2019 classes. They are being held in each \u2018para\u2019 or \u2018mohalla\u2019 with not more than 10 children in each. The children range from Grade 3 to 6. Social distancing norms were by and large followed in all classes.   But the most interesting part of our visit is, in every class we visit the children are so focussed on what is being taught that they choose to ignore our presence. An ideal situation really! But this is the first time I am witnessing anything like this. They acknowledge our presence only when the teacher directs her attention to us and promptly switches to her the moment she starts teaching again.  Volunteer Dipti Roy Even the most restless child, who we later realise is extremely intelligent, is actually looking in the general direction of the teacher and continuously fidgeting!  Both the teacher and we think he is not paying any attention, but he answers all questions asked of him and gives the most intelligent answers when we ask him questions, very animatedly.  Is it the pandemic which has made them so focussed or is it the proximity to Kolkata, perhaps they are more likely to meet people like us, I wonder? The volunteers clearly have a great rapport with the children, they know the names of each child in their respective classrooms. The mother\u2019s group we meet are equally enthusiastic about these classes. They clearly understand the value of these classes in these troubled times when the schools are shut. They are practically unanimous in their demand for more supplementary reading material for the children. Bandana Lohara, is one of the \u2018Readiness\u2019 package contacts. Here she is seen displaying her various science models that she has created with the children. Bandana has been with us as a library group leader since 2016. The dark clouds of a retreating monsoon and ominous rumbling sounds of an imminent storm hasten our departure from Haroa! But not before we encounter a party of frolicking villagers, on our way out. Yesterday was Vishwakarma Puja and the party continues! \u00a0 \n\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Us\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Pratham  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBoard  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLeadership  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPartners  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tPrograms\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEducation  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVocational Training   \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnnual Status of Education Report  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPratham Council For Vulnerable Children  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCovid Response  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLearning Readiness & Catch Up  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLessons from the Pandemic  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tGet Involved\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJob Opportunities  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInternships  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tDelhi Office\t\t\t\t\t\t \nB- 4/59, Safdarjung Enclave\n1st Floor, New Delhi - 110 029\nEmail: info@pratham.org\nContact number: 01141651638\n\n\t\t Mumbai Office \nY.B.

Some viewers were or still are hockey players; many are hockey lovers. But crores of people were simply travelling with you on your amazing journey. I was one of them. I work in education. As I followed you, I felt it was not enough to just be a fan. You have compelled people like me to travel much further along on the path that you have opened. For us, in education, we saw so many lessons in what you were doing. Learnings that are relevant and important for the situation we are in today. There is much that we learned from you but today I am going to talk about only five of these lessons. First: Very often difficulties at home and problems in the family, stop us. Today\u2019s constraints prevent us from seeing the opportunities of tomorrow. We feel that we must think of everyone. We think it is selfish to think just of ourselves. The burden of others\u2019 expectations can make your own dreams evaporate. But you did not let this happen. You lent a hand at home and worked alongside your family. But at the same time, you persuaded, cajoled, explained, sulked and argued but eventually changed the minds of those around you. In the coming days, when schools re-open, in all corners of our country, hundreds of girls will have to struggle as you did. And when they struggle, they will see you in front of them, giving inspiration and courage. Second: In the early days of the Olympic tournament in Tokyo, you could not win several matches. But you did not give up. Similarly, around the country, there are so many children who are behind. Well below the level of their class. They sit silently at the back of the room. No one expects that they will learn. Slowly their attachment to school loosens and after a while the connection snaps. In some ways, you were like them but you were different. You showed the way with your persistence and with the faith you had in yourselves. You did not feel hopeless just because you were behind, to begin with. You believed in your own capability to fight back. Even before the pandemic, close to 50% of children in rural India in class five could not read. Perhaps they have fallen further behind in the last year and a half. But like our hockey team, our children too can come from behind and go far ahead. Third: Behind every player, there are many hands, heads and hearts. Mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, others in the family, friends give them the support and care that is critical. Then, of course, there are the teachers and coaches. Today the training that you, our hockey girls, have received is truly world-class. But to get to this stage, the credit goes to many other unseen heroes.Someone somewhere in the village or district, saw you playing and recognized in you the grit to grow and the potential to go far. Every disciple carries a piece of the guru in themselves. Each teacher moulds the child in a way that enables the student to progress. We must remember that every teacher from class one to high school has the responsibility to recognize the talent in each child and to pave their path accordingly. Fourth: Teamwork. A hockey champion cannot simply be an individual. A match cannot be won without the whole team contributing to the success. You have proved this point convincingly. Confidence in each other, building a strategy based on your strengths, translating the plan into success on the field \u2013 over and over again you showed us how this is done. We have to do this too, in our schools and classrooms. Our education system gives high priority to individual excellence, but not to teamwork. However, the secret of winning in life and in livelihoods is in teams working smoothly together. Fifth: Without tiring, without fading, you showed us how to play. You played your heart out all the way to the end. Never say die. Never give up. Whether a medal was won or not, you proved to the country and to the world what champions are made of. A thousand salaams to your courage. Immense thanks for being our inspiration. Your coach tweeted after the last game \u201cas long as you work hard and believe dreams can come true\u201d. We must have dreams. Without an aim, there can be no direction. With a clear goal in front, hard work, dedication, self-confidence and discipline will help us move forward. We thank you deeply for being who you are and doing what you do. In this difficult year, you have set the entire education system on the right course.

The plan entails employing the mothers in Self-Help\u00a0Groups (SHGs) and equipping them to support children\u2019s learning. The training was\u00a0launched on March 31, 2021 at the Saradish Roy Smriti Swasthiya Bitan, a\u00a0rural healthcare centre run by the Liver Foundation at Nagari village, Siuri \u2013\u00a01 block of Birbhum in West Bengal. Pora Lekha is a collaborative initiative of Liver Foundation and Pratham Education Foundation, where Liver Foundation will mobilise and manage the SHG members to run these community supplementary classes for the 5 to 10 year olds, they will also print and distribute all teaching and learning materials (TLMs) shared by Pratham, who will additionally train the SHG members, and provide the initial academic support and monitoring when the initiative is rolled out. \u00a0Pora Lekha aims to create and nourish informal spaces for learning and play as a supplement to schools. Speaking about the initiative Dr. Abhijit Chowdhury, secretary of the Liver Foundation said, \u201cthe need of the hour is to expand the concept of education beyond the confines of the classroom. Self Help Groups, are geared towards the realisation of social and economic independence of women, are the perfect platforms to lead such an initiative. Traditionally SHGs have been centred around economic activities like savings and access to microfinance. However, the voluntary nature of membership and their role in countering traditional hierarchies makes it less prone to the individualistic, incentive-oriented attitude that other social organisations are more prone to.\u201d Dr. Chowdhury also believes that it is possible to reorient them towards socially necessary tasks: \u201cIf their newfound confidence can be utilised to combat pressing social problems such as this, not only will SHG members experience greater self-reliance and self-respect but it will also provide new hope for children who have been deprived of access to education\u201d.  Dr. Chowdhury felt the necessity of providing academic support to primary school-going\u00a0children and young children because of the \u201cdevastation caused by the lockdown on foundational learning of children.\u201d Being a member of the West Bengal state task force in tackling COVID-19 he travelled extensively into the interiors of the state and could see the plight of the young children. duringthe lockdown noticed the devastating effect on primary education. Earlier the initiative was formally inaugurated on March 30th in Nagari GP, starting from village Pathra, then onto Baragram, Latabuni, Patharchapri and finally ending at village Nagari. Liver Foundation\u2019s prior healthcare initiatives in this area meant that they could leverage vast reserves of goodwill and trust among the people, and this translated into big crowds and widespread enthusiasm among the assembled children, their mothers and SHG members. The training on the 31st was started by a three member Pratham team, who imparted training to 65 SHG volunteers. Amidst a fun filled interactive day the Pratham team members \u00a0started the session explaining the inadequacies of primary education in India and also tried to understandhow the volunteers perceive the issue. They then explained the basis of Pratham\u2019s testing tool, meant to gauge the level of reading and numerical abilities of children between the ages of 5-10. They were taught how to put forward questions with varying levels of difficulty to children and to record their answers carefully in an observation format.  All the participants were very enthusiastic during this participative training and had many questions to ask which were very pertinent to the topic being discussed. They are very motivated at the prospect of working collectively to address the lack in their children\u2019s education. Today, April 1 onwards till April 4, the 65 SHG members will conduct a census of all 5 to 10-year-old children who live in the 22 target villages. The training will resume on April 5 to equip the ladies with the skills necessary to impart basic lessons in reading and mathematics, based on the current levels of each 5 to 10-year-old children. We look forward to a very successful collaboration between Liver Foundation and Pratham Education Foundation in West Bengal. \u2018Para Lekha\u2019 will begin in earnest after the training next week, and hope turns into a replicable model employing SHG members in West Bengal! \n\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Us\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Pratham  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBoard  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLeadership  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPartners  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tPrograms\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEducation  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVocational Training   \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnnual Status of Education Report  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPratham Council For Vulnerable Children  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCovid Response  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLearning Readiness & Catch Up  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLessons from the Pandemic  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tGet Involved\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJob Opportunities  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInternships  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tDelhi Office\t\t\t\t\t\t \nB- 4/59, Safdarjung Enclave\n1st Floor, New Delhi - 110 029\nEmail: info@pratham.org\nContact number: 01141651638\n\n\t\t Mumbai Office \nY.B.

The plan entails employing the mothers in Self-Help\u00a0Groups (SHGs) and equipping them to support children\u2019s learning. The training was\u00a0launched on March 31, 2021 at the Saradish Roy Smriti Swasthiya Bitan, a\u00a0rural healthcare centre run by the Liver Foundation at Nagari village, Siuri \u2013\u00a01 block of Birbhum in West Bengal. Pora Lekha is a collaborative initiative of Liver Foundation and Pratham Education Foundation, where Liver Foundation will mobilise and manage the SHG members to run these community supplementary classes for the 5 to 10 year olds, they will also print and distribute all teaching and learning materials (TLMs) shared by Pratham, who will additionally train the SHG members, and provide the initial academic support and monitoring when the initiative is rolled out. \u00a0Pora Lekha aims to create and nourish informal spaces for learning and play as a supplement to schools. Speaking about the initiative Dr. Abhijit Chowdhury, secretary of the Liver Foundation said, \u201cthe need of the hour is to expand the concept of education beyond the confines of the classroom. Self Help Groups, are geared towards the realisation of social and economic independence of women, are the perfect platforms to lead such an initiative. Traditionally SHGs have been centred around economic activities like savings and access to microfinance. However, the voluntary nature of membership and their role in countering traditional hierarchies makes it less prone to the individualistic, incentive-oriented attitude that other social organisations are more prone to.\u201d Dr. Chowdhury also believes that it is possible to reorient them towards socially necessary tasks: \u201cIf their newfound confidence can be utilised to combat pressing social problems such as this, not only will SHG members experience greater self-reliance and self-respect but it will also provide new hope for children who have been deprived of access to education\u201d.  Dr. Chowdhury felt the necessity of providing academic support to primary school-going\u00a0children and young children because of the \u201cdevastation caused by the lockdown on foundational learning of children.\u201d Being a member of the West Bengal state task force in tackling COVID-19 he travelled extensively into the interiors of the state and could see the plight of the young children. duringthe lockdown noticed the devastating effect on primary education. Earlier the initiative was formally inaugurated on March 30th in Nagari GP, starting from village Pathra, then onto Baragram, Latabuni, Patharchapri and finally ending at village Nagari. Liver Foundation\u2019s prior healthcare initiatives in this area meant that they could leverage vast reserves of goodwill and trust among the people, and this translated into big crowds and widespread enthusiasm among the assembled children, their mothers and SHG members. The training on the 31st was started by a three member Pratham team, who imparted training to 65 SHG volunteers. Amidst a fun filled interactive day the Pratham team members \u00a0started the session explaining the inadequacies of primary education in India and also tried to understandhow the volunteers perceive the issue. They then explained the basis of Pratham\u2019s testing tool, meant to gauge the level of reading and numerical abilities of children between the ages of 5-10. They were taught how to put forward questions with varying levels of difficulty to children and to record their answers carefully in an observation format.  All the participants were very enthusiastic during this participative training and had many questions to ask which were very pertinent to the topic being discussed. They are very motivated at the prospect of working collectively to address the lack in their children\u2019s education. Today, April 1 onwards till April 4, the 65 SHG members will conduct a census of all 5 to 10-year-old children who live in the 22 target villages. The training will resume on April 5 to equip the ladies with the skills necessary to impart basic lessons in reading and mathematics, based on the current levels of each 5 to 10-year-old children. We look forward to a very successful collaboration between Liver Foundation and Pratham Education Foundation in West Bengal. \u2018Para Lekha\u2019 will begin in earnest after the training next week, and hope turns into a replicable model employing SHG members in West Bengal! \n\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Us\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Pratham  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBoard  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLeadership  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPartners  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tPrograms\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEducation  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVocational Training   \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnnual Status of Education Report  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPratham Council For Vulnerable Children  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCovid Response  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLearning Readiness & Catch Up  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLessons from the Pandemic  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tGet Involved\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJob Opportunities  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInternships  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tDelhi Office\t\t\t\t\t\t \nB- 4/59, Safdarjung Enclave\n1st Floor, New Delhi - 110 029\nEmail: info@pratham.org\nContact number: 01141651638\n\n\t\t Mumbai Office \nY.B.

For the first time, a number was put to status of basic learning in the country. ASER is linked with a constructive satyagraha to insist on the right of the citizens to participate in the functioning of the government. We believe that good work done by governments, and there is a lot of it, deserves to be applauded. But governments must also take outcome oriented steps to improve performance of schools. ASER 2006 records that the proportion of out of school children has not diminished. They are entering formal schooling one year too early and older children are in lower classes in large numbers. Read here for more findings.  ASER 2007 presents data on school enrollment, learning levels and comprehension skills, among others. This is the fourth year of ASER and this unique survey of the status of learning in rural India has become a much awaited report for policy makers. Are Private schools really performing better than government schools? ASER survey has the answers. Find the details here ASER 2010 reported a substantial increase in school enrolment figures but no visible improvement in the quality of education. ASER 2011 found that private school enrollment in most states is increasing although the Right to Education Act for free and compulsory education is in place. Over 25% children in rural India go to private schools and the numbers are likely to rise.  \u201d ASER 2012 noted that levels of reading and math at every level were not only poor but\ndeclining in many states. \u201c ASER 2013 tells the story of a widening gap in learning levels in rural India.

This crisis not only affects overall learning levels, but increases gaps, with the learning of children from disadvantaged households more deeply affected. Children from disadvantaged households miss learning opportunities because they lack access to remotely delivered instructional content. Children in poorer households are less likely to access computers and the internet, as well as TV, radio, or smartphones. For instance, 2.2 billion \u2013 or 2 in 3 children and young people aged 25 years or less \u2013 do not have internet access at home. In some contexts, disadvantaged parents are less engaged in their children\u2019s learning. During school closings, children are more dependent on the academic support they receive from their parents, which some may not be able to provide. The pandemic may have, however, led parents of all backgrounds to provide more support. The pandemic has led to uncertainty and disruption. 39 billion in-school meals have been missed during school closures and an estimated 150 million more children were pushed into poverty. This economic crisis, coupled with children\u2019s absence from school and reduced access to services offered through schools, may have increased children\u2019s work. Children who work tend to also be disadvantaged in their learning in school. Even before COVID, the global \u201clearning crisis\u201d was well acknowledged. In many parts of the world, even after five years of schooling, a majority of children could not read a basic text fluently or do simple arithmetic. Pre-crisis, an estimated 53 per cent of children were in \u201clearning poverty\u201d \u2013 they could not understand a simple text by the age of 10. It is expected that COVID is leading to an additional 10 per cent of children in learning poverty Even within the same setting, prolonged school closures likely had differential impacts on children of different backgrounds. On top of existing inequalities, the pandemic likely worsened the situation, especially for children whose learning levels were already weak. The above-mentioned factors increase learning gaps, even within the same classroom, which means teachers will face students at different starting points when schools reopen. In response to this challenge and to accelerate the recovery process, it is important for teachers to understand the performance level of students when they return to the classroom in order to design lesson plans appropriate to the students\u2019 current needs. The best tool to achieve this is formative assessment, which helps both teachers and students by giving them feedback about how individual learning is progressing. Formative assessment is a range of formal and informal assessment procedures conducted by teachers during the learning process in order to modify teaching and learning activities to improve student achievement. Prior to COVID-19, initiatives by UNICEF, Pratham (an innovative learning organization created to improve the quality of education in India) and others successfully used formative assessment: All this accumulated experience is proving useful now that formative assessment is more necessary than ever. When schools reopen, these tools are essential for identifying children\u2019s learning levels, and to design remediation, compensation, catch up and accelerated programmes accordingly. In Mongolia, after schools were closed from February to September 2020, affecting over 600,000 children, the first month of the new term focused on assessment of learning and remedial lessons and activities. UNICEF supported development and distribution of teacher guidelines for remedial classes covering all core subjects from pre-primary to upper secondary. Teachers used the first classes for formative assessments to gauge children\u2019s learning, and remedial classes were then adapted to the children\u2019s specific needs. Earlier, UNICEF found that most Mongolian children wanted catch-up opportunities. These classes responded to children\u2019s feedback, aiming to reduce stress and anxiety, and letting students ease back into their learning routines. Teachers\u2019 feedback indicated that remedial classes were much needed and helpful, but more time was needed to fully address gaps. Global map of school closures caused by COVID-19 In Madagascar, national scale up of their summer catch-up programme is being adapted to kick off school reopening, incorporating formative assessment. A similar UNICEF-supported program in Uzbekistan combined remediation and long-term reorientation of instruction, with a focus on teaching at the level of students. It identified priority learning outcomes and success criteria; assessed learning loss and knowledge gaps, favouring methods enabling automated results calculations; and designed catch-up plans for students with the greatest learning gaps. The most experienced teachers led the individual or group catch up sessions. Programme Guidelines have been disseminated across the country. In two provinces, Sri Lanka modelled return-to-school remediation packages including formative assessment, curriculum adaptation, and support for training around individualized learning. Similarly, formative assessment tools developed in Bangladesh and Malawi will also support school reopenings. Much remains to be done. Now more than ever, policy makers must prioritize support to teachers to strengthen their capacity to effectively use assessment. That is why Pratham and UNICEF are currently exploring ways to collaborate in promoting the use of formative assessment in classrooms around the world.

In India, the Jammu and Kashmir region is one such area which has been impacted by conflict for decades. The violence in the region affects children\u2019s mental health in myriad ways. In such a context, children\u2019s building of life skills becomes increasingly important to help them navigate the multiple challenges they face every day. Life skills refer to a large group of psychosocial and interpersonal skills that promote psychosocial well-being leading to healthy and productive lives. The unique conditions of these areas, coupled with the ongoing pandemic, necessitate contextualized solutions that meet children\u2019s needs and are feasible. While the need for contextual relevance is well established, even for approaches towards life skills, challenges often lie in executing such approaches. The synergy between content creation and implementation design is key in ensuring that the intervention is responsive to the local situation. Recognizing these interdependencies, we outline three guiding principles that we learned through developing a life skills intervention in Jammu and Kashmir, India. Understanding context Jammu and Kashmir have experienced conflict for decades. Some districts often witness prolonged school closures due to political instability or extreme weather conditions, thereby affecting children\u2019s learning. Frequent Internet and mobility restrictions due to political unrest also limit learning opportunities. Pratham began work in the region in 2015 and currently works with children in Grades 1-8 to strengthen foundational literacy and numeracy. In 2019, we partnered with UNICEF India to develop a life skills intervention. Pratham\u2019s life skills framework focuses on six main competencies: self-awareness, self-management, interpersonal skills, problem-solving, leadership, and technical skills Our needs assessment in June 2019 helped understand the needs, aspirations, and experiences of different program and community stakeholders. It also brought forward how factors such as unemployment, drug abuse, religious, and demographic differences, coupled with the larger socio-political conflict, influence people\u2019s daily lives and impact the mental health of children, parents, team members, and other stakeholders profoundly. The three guiding principles The learnings from the needs assessment and multiple discussions with community actors highlight the need to keep the context of the region at the core of our programming. The following three principles support attention to this context in designing a life skills intervention for the region: 1. Consistent and systematic inputs from the community Needs assessment is approached as a continuous process and not a one-time activity. We have built continuous insights from the community into the intervention and content design through a systematic approach consisting of multiple field visits, feedback from implementation teams, and interactions with community actors. For example, children\u2019s access to digital devices informs content delivery, and regular feedback calls with community actors help direct content creation. Even pre-Covid-19, the intervention centered on the community\u2019s needs given the frequent mobility and Internet disruptions. This helped foster strong relations and teaching-learning practices in the community which are now being leveraged to enable learning continuity during the pandemic. Volunteers who live in the same neighborhoods as the children are mobilized to help facilitate learning within community spaces or remotely. Such processes help build sustainability and community ownership. 2. Collaborative content creation by leveraging inputs from multiple partners The UNICEF team, Pratham's life skills and academic (English, Math, Hindi, and Urdu) content teams, and the implementation team participated in multiple content creation workshops. These workshops helped understand gender responsive and conflict-sensitive approaches to direct content creation. Additionally, the involvement of the different teams helped foster a deeper understanding of the approach towards life skills and its impact. Through the implementation team\u2019s insights on regional characteristics and children\u2019s interests, activities focusing on appropriate life skills were developed. The activities were designed such that community volunteers can easily implement them, particularly during periods of limited mobility. Each of these teams continue to contribute their own set of skills during review discussions, thereby combining two key aspects of designing curriculum and implementation: technical know-how and contextual understanding. 3. Blending life skills in content, teacher behaviors, and methods The intervention incorporates life skills as an overall \u2018lens\u2019 or \u2018approach\u2019 and not just a separate \u2018module\u2019. Therefore, along with creation of stand-alone life skills sessions, the process of collaborative content creation helps integrate life skills within academic content through stories and activities. For example, an English language story for Grade 6-8 learners depicts two goats reaching the centre of a narrow bridge and then arguing to cross it first. The message encourages the development of creative thinking and cooperation through a reflection question on what will happen next. The content is also reviewed to encourage usage of context-relevant as well as gender-transformative imagery and examples. Additionally, the periodic training for the implementation team, conducted via participatory training methodologies, helps build their understanding of life skills and develop effective teacher behaviours. This supports creation of an enabling environment for improving life skills among children.  While the region faces many challenges that hinder learning, consistently responding to the evolving situation can help programs remain relevant and address any gaps. Building on this progress, we aim to work towards creating a conducive learning ecosystem which is both relevant to the local conditions and resilient to its dynamics. \n\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Us\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Pratham  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBoard  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLeadership  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPartners  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tPrograms\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEducation  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVocational Training   \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnnual Status of Education Report  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPratham Council For Vulnerable Children  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCovid Response  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLearning Readiness & Catch Up  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLessons from the Pandemic  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tGet Involved\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJob Opportunities  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInternships  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tDelhi Office\t\t\t\t\t\t \nB- 4/59, Safdarjung Enclave\n1st Floor, New Delhi - 110 029\nEmail: info@pratham.org\nContact number: 01141651638\n\n\t\t Mumbai Office \nY.B.

Additionally, the involvement of the different teams helped foster a deeper understanding of the approach towards life skills and its impact. Through the implementation team\u2019s insights on regional characteristics and children\u2019s interests, activities focusing on appropriate life skills were developed. The activities were designed such that community volunteers can easily implement them, particularly during periods of limited mobility. Each of these teams continue to contribute their own set of skills during review discussions, thereby combining two key aspects of designing curriculum and implementation: technical know-how and contextual understanding. 3. Blending life skills in content, teacher behaviors, and methods The intervention incorporates life skills as an overall \u2018lens\u2019 or \u2018approach\u2019 and not just a separate \u2018module\u2019. Therefore, along with creation of stand-alone life skills sessions, the process of collaborative content creation helps integrate life skills within academic content through stories and activities. For example, an English language story for Grade 6-8 learners depicts two goats reaching the centre of a narrow bridge and then arguing to cross it first. The message encourages the development of creative thinking and cooperation through a reflection question on what will happen next. The content is also reviewed to encourage usage of context-relevant as well as gender-transformative imagery and examples. Additionally, the periodic training for the implementation team, conducted via participatory training methodologies, helps build their understanding of life skills and develop effective teacher behaviours. This supports creation of an enabling environment for improving life skills among children.  While the region faces many challenges that hinder learning, consistently responding to the evolving situation can help programs remain relevant and address any gaps. Building on this progress, we aim to work towards creating a conducive learning ecosystem which is both relevant to the local conditions and resilient to its dynamics. \n\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Us\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Pratham  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBoard  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLeadership  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPartners  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tPrograms\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEducation  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVocational Training   \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnnual Status of Education Report  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPratham Council For Vulnerable Children  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCovid Response  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLearning Readiness & Catch Up  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLessons from the Pandemic  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tGet Involved\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJob Opportunities  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInternships  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tDelhi Office\t\t\t\t\t\t \nB- 4/59, Safdarjung Enclave\n1st Floor, New Delhi - 110 029\nEmail: info@pratham.org\nContact number: 01141651638\n\n\t\t Mumbai Office \nY.B.

The 2017 ASER makes an attempt to look \u2018beyond basics\u2019 and explore a wider set of domains beyond foundational reading. ASER 2018 is a nation-wide household survey that provides a snapshot of children\u2019s schooling and learning. ASER 2019 \u2018Early Years\u2019 collected data on the schooling or pre-schooling status of children in the age group 4-8 and , in addition, explored selected competencies that international research has identified as important predictors of future success. ASER 2020 survey was one-of-a-kind in the history of ASER. This was the first ever phone survey conducted across the country.

About the speaker: Samyukta Subramanian leads early childhood education (ECE) and early grades programs across many Indian states and has extensive experience working with government officials, private sector partners, and non-profit leaders to develop and implement education initiatives. Her focus has been on India\u2019s pre-primary education landscape and improving ECE outcomes at scale.

Efforts toward government and community capacity building are more important now than ever, to ensure that the progress made with digital interventions during the pandemic is leveraged effectively going forward. The curriculum is there, but right now we need to focus on our children, and bring them to the level where they feel confident that whatever has been lost has been regained quickly. It takes a community to educate a child \u2013 and that happens best when the community is excited and engaged with learning. COVID has taught us that instead of children going to school, the school has to come to the child.

Until then it was said that more than 97 percent children all over rural India have access to school, although about 50 percent in class 5 cannot read a class 2 passage, according to the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER). We had successfully created access to classrooms and to input provision of educational processes called schooling, but have not done too well in the area of enabling children to access knowledge and skills. A new education policy that lays down a pathway to a less rigid education system focusing on outcomes has now been announced. It probably reflects the general desire for greater freedom to access knowledge. But before we get there, the current situation deserves a look. By the end of March, schools in many countries that were experiencing the pandemic had started reopening their schools with caution, while Indian schools had just begun to shut down. As I write this, the Covid-19 situation seems to be coming under control in Delhi and Mumbai, but in other parts of the country the numbers are growing day by day. Yet, businesses are opening slowly and are adjusting to a \u2018new normal\u2019. Schools were shut down in one shot, but reopening them is not going to be as easy. It will be difficult for systems, private or public, to convince parents that schools are going to be safe places to be in. Everyone is going to wait for a vaccine. It is anybody\u2019s guess at this time as to how long things will take to settle down, and for us to figure out a \u2018new normal\u2019 for schools. How different it will be from the old normal is a good question to ask. Quick adoption of digital technology at a phenomenal speed has played a major role in adjusting to the \u2018work from home\u2019 and \u2018stay at home\u2019 situation. Of course, the benefits of this new technology adoption are going to those who can work from home, have the digital devices that are needed, can afford to use these devices, and have the skills to use them. Many have learnt new skills quickly, but all the other factors do limit a family\u2019s or individual\u2019s access to services and facilities in the Covid-19 environment. That includes access to education. Or, shall we say, schooling? The education sector, like all others, has had to deal with issues of access to technology in Covid-19 times. Only, the issues are a bit more complex given daily human interactions. As schools began to shut down in mid-March, those that already had an existing component of digital home-learning found it relatively easy to switch to online learning. Their students had good access to technology and enough space at home. At the same time, the private and government schools that cater to poorer children were trying to figure out what they could do with technology. Although \u2018online education\u2019 was much-talked-about, the realisation that it could not be strictly online but more like \u2018tech-assisted remote learning\u2019 was clear from day one, given the problems of accessibility of devices and connectivity. Available data indicate that about 10 percent of Indian homes have access to computers; they also have smartphones. Another 40 percent only have smartphones with access to the internet. Add to this about 40 percent who neither have computers nor smartphones, but use simple cellphones. The remaining 10 percent have no phone connection at all. Then there is the fact that in many of the poorer households, women and girls do not have access to phones, and when the men go out to work, children cannot use phones at all. Clearly, more than 50 percent of the population in India is not in a position to access education through internet-based activities at this time. Television coverage in India is also limited to about two-third of households, more urban than rural. Radio sets were present in every household once upon a time. Now, most people listen to the radio on their cellphones and smartphone apps. In short, smartphones guarantee access to all media. In the absence of a smartphone, media access is limited. Layered access to devices and the internet means that real online learning, whether useful or not, would be possible only for a small percentage of the population. Many government and private schools started sending lessons to children via WhatsApp. Children are supposed to complete the exercises and return them to their teachers. But it was soon realised that such activities still leave out a large proportion of urban poor and rural populations. Several state governments started beaming television (TV) programmes for classes 1 to 8 with the help of NGOs, and a few are trying out radio programmes as well. All these efforts are certainly intended to ensure that even in these difficult times there is access to some process of education for all, and children are kept engaged. But, given the existing unevenness of access to technology, how many children or homes do they reach? Probably no more than 40 percent. How effective are the efforts where they reach? After all, motivation to study school texts, which is lacking in the best of times, is even lower under these circumstances. Will the gap between the privileged and the under-privileged grow during the shutdown period? The cynic in me says it is already so wide, how much more can it grow? The ASER has shown year after year that in class 5, 44 percent children in government schools can read a class 2 text, while 65 percent of private school (rural) children can do the same. Will this 20 percent gap grow bigger? It should be a subject of research. But, more than studying it, there is a need to remedy it. I recently came across a 20-second video clip of a little boy trying to recite a multiplication table. It sounds like a multiplication table, but numbers are all over the place. Somehow he lands up at \u201c12 X 8 = 108\u201d and looks very uncertain. Finally, he flashes a charming smile and says, \u201c\u2026forgot everything during lockdown!\u201d. Children like him in our elementary schools will suffer a learning loss due to school shutdowns. The issue of \u2018learning loss\u2019 during summer vacations is well-known in the US. My organisation, Pratham, has Indian data that indicate how children with poorer reading abilities further lose them during vacation periods. We also have experience and rigorous large-scale evidence to show that such loss can be recovered rather quickly by doing focussed \u2018catch-up\u2019 activities in schools or village communities. The government of India announced the launch of a Foundational Literacy and Numeracy Mission from December 2020. We do not know if schools will be open by then or not, but it is certainly possible to do \u2018catch-up\u2019 activities as part of school reopening protocol. If this is not done, the 50 percent-odd children who are not able to read and comprehend, as repeatedly shown by ASER, will suffer further permanent damage. It\u2019s likely to be the same for nearly 60 percent of children who do not have access to or did not participate in \u2018tech-assisted remote learning\u2019 activities regularly. Technology applications have been creating a lot of excitement ever since schools shut down. The government of India has also announced a number of intended initiatives to build upon the momentum generated in the last three months. The assumption clearly is that the application of technology will improve quality of education. This may not happen immediately, but once technology enters education in a big way, it will accelerate changes. It is obvious that the devices gap will have to be taken care of. But, hardware and software should not be slaves to the syllabus and textbooks\u2014the central pillars of the education system\u2014as is the case now. The new education policy has made the important announcement of making class 10 and 12 exams low stakes and formative, not dependent upon memorisation of texts. This will help to redefine the relationship between learning and textbooks. Today textbook and \u201ccompleting the syllabus\u201d dominate all educational processes, and we have equated knowledge with whatever exists in textbooks. What will happen if the link between textbooks and examinations is snapped? Examinations and certifications have become enemies of the freedom to access knowledge in the name of their friendship with the process of instruction tied to textbooks. The new education policy aspires to allow students to choose whatever subjects they want to, and more or less carve out the kind of degree or diploma they want. Given the state our educational institutions are in, this may sound close to impossible but it is important to at least present such freedom as an aspiration. Such freedom to choose what you want to learn cannot be realised without easy access to knowledge, and credible assessment and certification mechanisms. The right to assess and certify was once limited only to governments and government-owned bodies. Over the last two decades, autonomous colleges and private universities have grown. The right to examine and certify has spread wider. But, the barriers to enter these institutions are very high and students who do not belong to these institutions will not be assessed and certified by them. If examinations can be held to decide which 10,000 of the 400,000 applicants are good enough to enter elite engineering institutions, why is it not possible to hold similar periodic examinations around the country to test \u2018external\u2019 students in different courses? What if a student in a remote village of, say, Odisha wants to get a class 10 CBSE (Central Board of Secondary Examination) certificate? Why does he need to be enrolled in a CBSE school? In today\u2019s day and age, freeing up the process of learning for those who want to exercise this freedom is important. Given today\u2019s technology, opening examination centres around the country could be as easy as it was to open internet cafes or public call office booths before that. There is a subtle difference between right to education, which is the right to being formally instructed, and the freedom to acquire knowledge, which may include the former. The world has moved to the latter.

The learning gain from a year\u2019s worth of schooling can be managed in three months if there is a strong focus on foundational skills, said the note by Rukmini Banerji, chief executive officer of Pratham Educational Foundation, a non-profit organisation. The conclusion is based on evidence from a \u2018Graded Learning Programme\u2019 (GLP), a collaborative effort between Pratham and the Uttar Pradesh Basic Education Department, implemented across the state in 2019. The programme used a \u2018Teaching-at-the-Right-Level\u2019 approach wherein students are classified according to their reading and mathematics skills, not age, as is the traditional practice. The aim of the programme was to build sustainable, innovative teaching-learning practices in schools, and strengthen the academic support capacity at block and district levels. Learning levels are particularly low in UP: More than 60% of Grade 3 students at government schools cannot read words as yet, according to findings from Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) 2018, an annual assessment of reading and arithmetic skills of India\u2019s school students. The GLP, conducted between January and May 2019, proved successful. In reading, it led to a gain of 14 percentage points in Grade 3 and 16.1 percentage points in Grade 4 students. A similar programme can thus undo the learning loss caused by the lockdown, which Pratham estimates, will be deeper than \u201csummer loss\u201d\u2013a notable drop in achievement levels noticed among students after summer vacations. Data from the GLP suggested a summer loss of 7 percentage points in reading abilities over three months among Grade 3 students in UP. \u201cGiven that everything shut suddenly and there was no time to wind up the last year and get ready for the next year, and the period of closure is getting longer, we assume that based on what happens in a normal school year, this time the loss will be deeper,\u201d said Banerji. The lockdown to limit the spread of the pandemic starting March 24\u2013now extended in Bihar, Nagaland and Sikkim, which are under complete lockdown\u2013has disrupted schooling across the country. There is no official statement yet on schools reopening. A study has estimated that upto 320 million Indian school students have been affected by school closures. Only about half of all children enrolled in Grade 5 could read at least Grade 2 level and do basic arithmetic operations, as per the national figures from ASER 2018. This implied that even in a normal school year, uninterrupted by events such as the ongoing pandemic, students are in need of immediate help in acquiring foundational skills in numeracy and literacy. These low levels of learning will further deepen due to shutdowns, affecting disadvantaged children. 2-3 hours daily of foundational skills For the programme, teachers assessed students one-on-one using the ASER tool for reading and for arithmetic. The data were collected before (baseline) and after (endline) its implementation\u2013January to February 2019 and from late April to early May 2019. Additionally, in anticipation of GLP re-starting in the 2019-20 academic year, many schools did a new baseline with their primary school children in August 2019. From these data, the usual \u201csummer loss\u201d in reading ability was found to be less than 10 percentage points for children who had completed either Grade 3 or Grade 4 and were already reading at Grade 2 level (\u2018story\u2019 level). Instructions at school ranged from 45 days to 70 days with at least two to three hours per day devoted to building foundational learning skills. Evidence from data measured in May 2019 showed gains in reading of 14 percentage points in Grade 3 and 16.1 percentage points in Grade 4. The gains with this programme noted between January and May 2019 were equal to the year-on-year gain normally seen. Approximately Rs 1,000 worth of extra material was printed for each school for Grades 1 to 5 (a little over Rs 5 per child), which included stories in large font, syllable charts, practice reading cards, and word problem booklets, according to the insight note. Teachers helped the children progress to the level of learning with various instructional activities and there were frequent reviews at school, block, district, and state level. Better learning outcomes and employment Building foundational skills at an early age is correlated to better learning outcomes, personal well-being, economic and national prosperity, found a 2014 study on literacy and numeracy skills among children in developing countries. Even one year of participation in a quality early childhood development programme can ensure higher school readiness levels, according to The India Early Childhood Education Impact Study by the ASER centre and the Centre for Early Childhood Education and Development. \u201cOnce you can read, you can do a lot of things on your own but if you can\u2019t read you can\u2019t do much on your own. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to have your foundations in place,\u201d Banerji explained. Echoing this is the National Foundational Literacy and Numeracy Mission to be launched by the end of 2020 along with the Draft National Education Policy 2019, which mentions the need to build foundational skills in Grades 1-5. Reorienting teaching Textbooks and learning material need to be completely reorganised once schools reopen, said Ameeta Mulla Wattal, principal of Springdales School, Pusa Road, Delhi. \u201cSchools need to prioritise content, while deciding what subjects and teaching methods they want to focus on. They should focus on language and math for Grades 1-3,\" she said. Every teacher in the GLP was equipped with training, to gather data for baseline and endline surveys. With funds for teacher training\u00a0down 87% in six years, there could be a shortage of resources for programmes such as GLP. A\u00a0study\u00a0that analysed school budgets from eight states showed that teacher salaries made up the largest share of school expenditure but spending on training, critical for\u00a0improved learning outcomes, has been poor. Scyon Quinny, who teaches Grades 8-12 at a government school in Mumbai, was of the view that students need to be assessed once schools reopen to understand the extent of learning loss and make necessary changes to methods of instruction. \u201cI am conducting online lessons but there definitely needs to be a curriculum change to adapt to online learning and teachers need to be adequately trained to use digital tools to teach,\u201d he said. Reorienting the curriculum to teach and learn what is\u00a0essential in the students\u2019 lives\u00a0is important. \u201cFor me we just need to figure out how to reprioritise,\u201d said Banerji. \u201cI don\u2019t think it has major budgetary requirements, it requires a major mindset shift. Are we willing to create space to help children who have fallen behind to catch up rather than move right away into the curriculum?\u201d Regular mid-days meals will ensure food security for the child and thus regular attendance, she added. \u201cThere are hardships at home, but the school can [have] a mediating influence in getting children back on track,\u201d she said. With mid-day meals\u00a0interrupted\u00a0by school and anganwadi closures during the pandemic, on March 18, the Supreme Court issued a\u00a0notice\u00a0to state governments to provide responses on dealing with this closure. \n\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Us\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Pratham  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBoard  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLeadership  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPartners  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tPrograms\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEducation  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVocational Training   \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnnual Status of Education Report  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPratham Council For Vulnerable Children  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCovid Response  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLearning Readiness & Catch Up  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLessons from the Pandemic  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tGet Involved\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJob Opportunities  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInternships  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tDelhi Office\t\t\t\t\t\t \nB- 4/59, Safdarjung Enclave\n1st Floor, New Delhi - 110 029\nEmail: info@pratham.org\nContact number: 01141651638\n\n\t\t Mumbai Office \nY.B.

Since 2005, the ASER report has been released like clockwork in January each year (except 2015), and the ASER approach to measurement has resonated with people in many countries across the Global South. Key features of this approach include the importance of conducting household-based rather than school-based assessments; a focus on oral, one-on-one assessment of foundational reading and arithmetic; a simple design that facilitates ease of administration as well as understanding of the results; and clear links between assessment results and action on the ground to improve them. In these fifteen years, the ASER approach has been adopted and adapted by organizations in many countries. Today, ASER-like assessments are conducted by organisations in Africa (Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Nigeria, Mali, Senegal, Mozambique, Botswana); America (Mexico and Nicaragua); and Asia (Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal). In 2015, these organizations came together to establish the People\u2019s Action for Learning (PAL) Network in order to advance our common agenda on ensuring that all children acquire at least basic reading and arithmetic skills. Indicator SDG 4.1.1 (a) of the Sustainable Development Goal for education (SDG 4) shows how this agenda has found an echo not just in these countries but across the world, and reflects what is today a global goal. The formulation of the SDGs underlined the importance of developing common methods and metrics to track progress towards these goals, and highlighted the fact that none of the existing large scale assessment models like TIMSS and PISA are able to generate comparable evidence on children\u2019s foundational skills in early grades. In 2018, PAL Network members took on the challenge of developing such a model. Inspired and informed by these fifteen years of Pratham\u2019s work, this tool \u2013 the International Common Assessment of Learning, or ICAN, was released this month. ICAN is an open-source, robust and easy-to-use tool that assesses foundational numeracy and is available in 11 languages. In 2005, the difference between schooling and learning was neither commonly accepted nor well understood, and Pratham\u2019s consistent emphasis on foundational skills and the importance of simple, robust tools to measure them have been instrumental in changing this landscape, not only in India but across the world. The ICAN tool and ICAN report are evidence of this trajectory. The ICAN report e-launch event which featured speakers from across the world, can be viewed here. ICAN can be used in a variety of settings: schools, households, or even locations such as refugee camps (where ASER-like tools have been used in a number of countries). Easily scalable tools like these are critical if we are to identify and support those who have been most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Although the consequences for children\u2019s physical, emotional, and intellectual well-being are not yet fully understood, these will undoubtedly include \u2018learning loss\u2019 as children\u2019s access to learning opportunities were interrupted with worldwide school closures. As schools reopen and the \u2018new normal\u2019 begins to take shape, tools like ICAN can help ensure that every child has access to schooling and learning. \n\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Us\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Pratham  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBoard  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLeadership  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPartners  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tPrograms\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEducation  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVocational Training   \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnnual Status of Education Report  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPratham Council For Vulnerable Children  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCovid Response  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLearning Readiness & Catch Up  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLessons from the Pandemic  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tGet Involved\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJob Opportunities  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInternships  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tDelhi Office\t\t\t\t\t\t \nB- 4/59, Safdarjung Enclave\n1st Floor, New Delhi - 110 029\nEmail: info@pratham.org\nContact number: 01141651638\n\n\t\t Mumbai Office \nY.B.

Key features of this approach include the importance of conducting household-based rather than school-based assessments; a focus on oral, one-on-one assessment of foundational reading and arithmetic; a simple design that facilitates ease of administration as well as understanding of the results; and clear links between assessment results and action on the ground to improve them. In these fifteen years, the ASER approach has been adopted and adapted by organizations in many countries.

Educationist Wilima Wadhwa explains why it isn\u2019t yet a viable option in rural India. * Online education, at the very least, requires a smartphone * Older boys might be pulled out of school to join the labour force * We have to come up with strategies that work, and they cannot be one-sided It\u2019s that time of the year when \u2014 under normal circumstances \u2014 schools in many parts of the country get ready to reopen after the summer break. Elsewhere, schools are about to close for the summer. In a year when \u201cnormalcy\u201d has been elusive, proposals to reopen schools are bound to invite scrutiny. So, in these trying times, lessons are being taught online. While urban schools have turned to digital classes, schools in rural India are struggling to curate a viable response to the virus-infected reality. Wilima Wadhwa, director of the New Delhi-based ASER Centre, an independent unit of non-governmental organisation Pratham, sheds light on the unique challenges faced by rural schools. Wadhwa is the architect of the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER), a rural survey conducted across the country to assess children\u2019s education status and learning levels. Covid-19 and the ensuing restrictions, she says, call for innovative approaches in rural education. There is no one-size-fits-all solution, she tells BLink. The answer may lie in local, community-based initiatives that address the educational challenges at the village level. Edited excerpts from an interview. How will Covid-19 and the lockdown impact schooling and education in rural India? Schools across the country were pretty much shut in March; in most cases the closure coincided with the end of the academic year. Some learning loss is observed when children join a new grade after the summer vacation. This year, kids in rural schools did not get the short window \u2014 classes in April \u2014 they usually get to settle into a new grade. So we are likely to see a certain learning loss. The fear, however, is what will happen when schools reopen. At the moment we don\u2019t know when that is going to happen. The virus is not going to go away until a vaccine is found. What will happen if one child in a school is infected? Will the school close again? As of now, there is no protocol in place. Social distancing is a necessity in the time of a pandemic. But the ground reality in government and low-cost private schools in rural India is different. Space is a constraint and social distancing difficult to execute. A lot of thought needs to go into these matters. Maybe we should have a different curriculum this year to bring children up to speed. We might have to encourage children to attend school, but how do we do that without assuring parents about the measures in place to keep children safe? In the interim, urban schools have moved to online classes. What are the practical problems in replicating the model in villages? Online education, at the very least, requires a smartphone. While the penetration of mobile phones is high in rural areas, most are not smartphones and connectivity levels vary vastly across states. There are practical hurdles as well. The smartphone usually belongs to the head of the family. As lockdowns are widely relaxed and the economy opens again, the adult owner of the smartphone is likely to head out to work, taking the phone with him. Even now 50 per cent of rural children have mothers who have never been to school. Twenty per cent children have first-generation learners in both their parents. So how can they help children with the learning material sent online? We have to come up with strategies that work, and they cannot be one-sided. For instance, what works in Tamil Nadu may not work in Uttar Pradesh. One needs to be flexible and learn to involve the local community in education. Do you think a model that works well at the local, village level and involves the community in education could take shape? I think that is the only way. In fact, Pratham runs a digital learning programme called Hybrid Learning, which is run completely in and by the community. We are present in about 1,000 villages and the programme targets students from Std V to VIII. Children are split into groups of five and two groups are given a tablet to share. The device is kept at a child\u2019s home, so the parents take care of keeping it charged. Learning material sent on the tablet is refreshed by volunteers. We have to take the community and parents along and find ways of supporting them with materials and other help that they need to help children through this academic year. Is the ASER Centre conducting a survey on online classes? We are doing a pilot survey involving over 4,500 households across the country, collecting basic information about the access to online school material in rural households. If the pilot is successful, we will conduct a larger representative survey. What kind of effect will the loss of jobs in cities and the reverse migration we are currently witnessing have on rural education? The education of girls will be a cause of worry. Girls are affected more in the event of a crisis. When it comes to access to technology in a household with many school-going children, one is likely to see the girl child being sidelined. Technology often raises the question of access and also of who has the right to access it. In rural India, 18-20 per cent children receive private tuition. With budgets squeezed and jobs lost, parents may not have money to spare for the private tutor. The role of the community gains significance under these circumstances. There may not be anybody at home to help a young child with study material, but a girl in the village who has completed high school can help. She can hold a class for small children. Choices will be made when a household faces financial constraints: Older boys might be pulled out of school to join the labour force, older girls might be forced to stay at home to look after younger siblings. So it remains to be seen how the rural education system responds to this reality\u2026 As of now, everything is up in the air. We don\u2019t know when schools in the villages are going to open. It is going to be a step-by-step process. We have to innovate and tailor solutions to our ground reality. \n\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Us\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Pratham  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBoard  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLeadership  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPartners  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tPrograms\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEducation  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVocational Training   \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnnual Status of Education Report  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPratham Council For Vulnerable Children  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCovid Response  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLearning Readiness & Catch Up  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLessons from the Pandemic  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tGet Involved\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJob Opportunities  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInternships  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tDelhi Office\t\t\t\t\t\t \nB- 4/59, Safdarjung Enclave\n1st Floor, New Delhi - 110 029\nEmail: info@pratham.org\nContact number: 01141651638\n\n\t\t Mumbai Office \nY.B.

Educationist Wilima Wadhwa explains why it isn\u2019t yet a viable option in rural India. * Online education, at the very least, requires a smartphone * Older boys might be pulled out of school to join the labour force * We have to come up with strategies that work, and they cannot be one-sided It\u2019s that time of the year when \u2014 under normal circumstances \u2014 schools in many parts of the country get ready to reopen after the summer break. Elsewhere, schools are about to close for the summer. In a year when \u201cnormalcy\u201d has been elusive, proposals to reopen schools are bound to invite scrutiny. So, in these trying times, lessons are being taught online. While urban schools have turned to digital classes, schools in rural India are struggling to curate a viable response to the virus-infected reality. Wilima Wadhwa, director of the New Delhi-based ASER Centre, an independent unit of non-governmental organisation Pratham, sheds light on the unique challenges faced by rural schools. Wadhwa is the architect of the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER), a rural survey conducted across the country to assess children\u2019s education status and learning levels. Covid-19 and the ensuing restrictions, she says, call for innovative approaches in rural education. There is no one-size-fits-all solution, she tells BLink. The answer may lie in local, community-based initiatives that address the educational challenges at the village level. Edited excerpts from an interview. How will Covid-19 and the lockdown impact schooling and education in rural India? Schools across the country were pretty much shut in March; in most cases the closure coincided with the end of the academic year. Some learning loss is observed when children join a new grade after the summer vacation. This year, kids in rural schools did not get the short window \u2014 classes in April \u2014 they usually get to settle into a new grade. So we are likely to see a certain learning loss. The fear, however, is what will happen when schools reopen. At the moment we don\u2019t know when that is going to happen. The virus is not going to go away until a vaccine is found. What will happen if one child in a school is infected? Will the school close again? As of now, there is no protocol in place. Social distancing is a necessity in the time of a pandemic. But the ground reality in government and low-cost private schools in rural India is different. Space is a constraint and social distancing difficult to execute. A lot of thought needs to go into these matters. Maybe we should have a different curriculum this year to bring children up to speed. We might have to encourage children to attend school, but how do we do that without assuring parents about the measures in place to keep children safe? In the interim, urban schools have moved to online classes. What are the practical problems in replicating the model in villages? Online education, at the very least, requires a smartphone. While the penetration of mobile phones is high in rural areas, most are not smartphones and connectivity levels vary vastly across states. There are practical hurdles as well. The smartphone usually belongs to the head of the family. As lockdowns are widely relaxed and the economy opens again, the adult owner of the smartphone is likely to head out to work, taking the phone with him. Even now 50 per cent of rural children have mothers who have never been to school. Twenty per cent children have first-generation learners in both their parents. So how can they help children with the learning material sent online? We have to come up with strategies that work, and they cannot be one-sided. For instance, what works in Tamil Nadu may not work in Uttar Pradesh. One needs to be flexible and learn to involve the local community in education. Do you think a model that works well at the local, village level and involves the community in education could take shape? I think that is the only way. In fact, Pratham runs a digital learning programme called Hybrid Learning, which is run completely in and by the community. We are present in about 1,000 villages and the programme targets students from Std V to VIII. Children are split into groups of five and two groups are given a tablet to share. The device is kept at a child\u2019s home, so the parents take care of keeping it charged. Learning material sent on the tablet is refreshed by volunteers. We have to take the community and parents along and find ways of supporting them with materials and other help that they need to help children through this academic year. Is the ASER Centre conducting a survey on online classes? We are doing a pilot survey involving over 4,500 households across the country, collecting basic information about the access to online school material in rural households. If the pilot is successful, we will conduct a larger representative survey. What kind of effect will the loss of jobs in cities and the reverse migration we are currently witnessing have on rural education? The education of girls will be a cause of worry. Girls are affected more in the event of a crisis. When it comes to access to technology in a household with many school-going children, one is likely to see the girl child being sidelined. Technology often raises the question of access and also of who has the right to access it. In rural India, 18-20 per cent children receive private tuition. With budgets squeezed and jobs lost, parents may not have money to spare for the private tutor. The role of the community gains significance under these circumstances. There may not be anybody at home to help a young child with study material, but a girl in the village who has completed high school can help. She can hold a class for small children. Choices will be made when a household faces financial constraints: Older boys might be pulled out of school to join the labour force, older girls might be forced to stay at home to look after younger siblings. So it remains to be seen how the rural education system responds to this reality\u2026 As of now, everything is up in the air. We don\u2019t know when schools in the villages are going to open. It is going to be a step-by-step process. We have to innovate and tailor solutions to our ground reality. \n\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Us\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Pratham  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBoard  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLeadership  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPartners  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tPrograms\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEducation  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVocational Training   \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnnual Status of Education Report  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPratham Council For Vulnerable Children  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCovid Response  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLearning Readiness & Catch Up  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLessons from the Pandemic  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tGet Involved\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJob Opportunities  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInternships  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tDelhi Office\t\t\t\t\t\t \nB- 4/59, Safdarjung Enclave\n1st Floor, New Delhi - 110 029\nEmail: info@pratham.org\nContact number: 01141651638\n\n\t\t Mumbai Office \nY.B.

The vital delivery of education to students has been upended across the world: in mid-April, 91 percent of all enrolled learners were out of school, according to UNESCO; ongoing efforts to mitigate the pandemic continued to keep more than 1.2 billion students in 168 countries home by mid-May. Unable to provide in-person education, many schools have turned to rapidly-designed remote learning \u2014 \u201ccrisis learning,\u201d in the words of a school superintendent in prosperous Silicon Valley, rather than \u201cbest practice.\u201d But even such crisis learning is not an option for the 42 percent of children worldwide who can\u2019t access the Internet at home or whose families lack computers, smartphones, and learning materials. Many children, even in ostensibly wealthy countries like the United States, rely on schools to provide them with nutritious meals; indeed, before the crisis, more than 300 million children worldwide were receiving meals at school, with many depending on school feeding programs as their main source of nutrition. Even worse, experts fear that a second shock \u2014 that of global economic recession \u2014 could compound and prolong the damage to education progress worldwide, and likewise accelerate hunger, malnutrition, and other social ills while causing many to put learning and life gains on hold. As the World Bank recently warned in The COVID-19 Pandemic: Shocks to Education and Policy Responses: \u201cWithout major efforts to counter their impacts, the school-closings shock will lead to learning loss, increased dropouts, and higher inequality, and the economic shock will exacerbate the damage, by depressing education demand and supply as it harms households. Together, they will inflict long-run costs on human capital and welfare.\u201d Remote learning is not an option for 42 percent of children worldwide. \nBut, added the World Bank, \u201cit is possible to counter those shocks, and to turn crisis into opportunity.\u201d The effort to do so successfully \u2014 and find opportunities to improve education delivery and access in the long run \u2014 is already underway, spearheaded by high-performing social sector organizations that are working nimbly and with tenacity to address the unprecedented challenges of this moment. Two that stand out are Pratham and CAMFED. These extraordinary nonprofits have been recognized with numerous awards, including the Skoll Award for Social Entrepreneurship and the WISE Prize for Education. \nPratham Pratham \u2014 one of the largest non-governmental organizations in India \u2014 operates with the mission of \u201cevery child in school and learning well.\u201d It has improved learning for over 75 million children in 21 of India\u2019s 29 states since its founding in 1994 (and in recent years expanded its model to ten African countries). Pratham created \u201cTeaching at the Right Level,\u201d a pedagogical approach that groups learners by ability rather than age or grade, and this then became the basis of its renowned \u201cRead India\u201d program, which develops basic reading, writing, and numeracy skills in children ages 6 to 14 through fun, hands-on activities. So when India\u2019s government announced the sudden lockdown of the entire country on March 21st, Pratham\u2019s leaders found themselves scrambling to ensure that the children they served in 11,000 villages across the country would continue \u201clearning well\u201d \u2014 and faring well \u2014 even without school. Recognizing the importance of finding an engaging yet accessible way to reach their students, Pratham describes their response as \u201chave a little fun and do a little learning.\u201d Initially, said Dharmenda Kumar, the State Head of Pratham in Uttarakhand, \u201cOur team did not have an idea how to leave field work and do it over the phone.\u201d But, they quickly adapted their model by reaching out to children, parents, and teachers using whatever technology was accessible. As Pratham CEO Dr. Rukmini Banerji explained in a World Bank panel discussion, each team member made about a hundred calls a day. They first contacted an \u201canchor\u201d in each village and from there reached out to one person in each hamlet, then all the houses in a hamlet, asking people to deliver messages or share phones until, finally, they reached \u201cthe last child.\u201d \nOnce contact with each individual learner was established, team members sent content and activities through WhatsApp and asked children to reply. \u201cWhatsApp is very effective,\u201d said Dr. Banerji, with the caveat that not all kids have access to smart phones, but do have access to basic phones. \u201cSo we had to quickly turn everything into 167 characters of SMS in 20 different languages\u2026sending little ideas and hoping for getting some feedback.\u201d As the lockdown wore on, the number of responses, assignments, and videos submitted increased. \u201cParents are engaging with the children\u2026 and they are seeing the progress which they are unable to see during the [regular] school days,\u201d said Oliver Balagadoss, Pratham\u2019s State Head in Tamil Nadu. Dr. Banerji added that the crisis had actually served to increase personal connection through the use of two-way communication technology; as she noted, quoting a colleague, \u201cWe are much further away, but we are actually much closer.\u2019\u201d Pratham found further hope in the increased collaboration it had observed among state governments and other entities who were scrambling to find ways to reach students (including through use of older technologies such as radio and television). \u201cThe crisis has created a lot of collaboration and we need to figure out how we are going to use it as we go on,\u201d said Dr. Banerji. Pratham co-founder and president Madhav Chavan echoed this sentiment in an op-ed, noting: \u201cWhenever the schools reopen, the sheer relief of going back to schools may also mean there will be the desire to go back to business as usual. But experiences from the shutdown period could be used to modify the education system as we enter a new normal situation.\u201d \nSuch modifications, he wrote, could include device libraries that would enable school-age children to better access online learning resources; recognizing that new technology can create \u201cnon-linear\u201d paths of learning; creating strong, contextualized content in multiple Indian languages; and preparing for an increasingly urgent need for lifelong learning in a fast-changing economy. \u201cOur experiences during lockdown are pointing us in the direction of necessary and possible changes,\u201d Chavan concluded. \u201cWe should reflect on those and act.\u201d \nCAMFED CAMFED (Campaign for Female Education) is an innovative international organization that seeks to tackle poverty and inequality by investing in girls and women in poor rural communities of sub-Saharan Africa. Its education programs have led to improved learning environments for more than five million children in Ghana, Malawi, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. So, as the pandemic shut down schools and forced tight restrictions on the movement of people, goods, and services, CAMFED jumped into action. \u201cWe know from experience that girls will be hardest hit,\u201d CAMFED wrote in their COVID-19 Action Brief, Girls and Women at the Frontline of COVID-19. \u201cThey are the least likely to return to school and most vulnerable to drop out. They also face an increased risk of early marriage and adolescent pregnancy.\u201d \nIn mid-April, UNESCO reported that 259 million students were out of school in sub-Saharan Africa, with more than half of these likely to be girls. Even when the schools finally reopen, the economic setback that hit families will remain, and with it loss of income, hunger, and lack of financial and social support for children to return to school. As CAMFED notes: \u201cThis puts pressure on girls, who often bear the brunt of household chores and caring responsibilities, to drop out, and to enter into early marriage. Girls also face higher risk of violence in the household. Research shows that, in crisis settings, girls\u2019 fear of violence is not limited to external dangers, but also to gender-based violence within families.\u201d To mitigate the pandemic\u2019s negative impact on the girls and women it supports, CAMFED leveraged its powerful alumni and partner network: 290,000 people on the ground who have the expertise and access to offer assistance. CAMFED volunteers are seeking to identify those most in need so as to disseminate food, soap, medicines, and sanitary pads to girls and their families. It has further sought to ensure that the 150,000 + members of the CAMFED Association (CAMA), which is the extraordinary network of young women leaders who were educated with CAMFED support (described in my previous article), are able to maintain access to mobile phones so they can disseminate factual information about the disease and dispel myths related to it. CAMFED is also training CAMA members to deliver a life skills curriculum and learning support via mobile devices in an effort to help build girls\u2019 confidence, encourage them to prioritize education, and set goals for their future. And, it is offering financial support to CAMA members who run businesses so they can repay outstanding loans, access working capital, and refocus their businesses so as to best serve their own communities in this time of global crisis. Lucy Lake, CEO of CAMFED, reflected, \u201cIt is a daily inspiration to witness the tenacity of the young women in our network in responding to this crisis. Having completed their own education against all odds, they are stepping up in extraordinary ways to beat the odds for other young people affected by this pandemic.\u201d \nOver my 25 years of experience and extensive research into what drives excellence and high performance in the social sector, I have seen time and again that well-managed organizations \u2014 such as Pratham and CAMFED \u2014 tend to fare best in times of massive change and disruption. As Dr. Banerji put it, \u201cIn this crisis often the best characteristics of people and organizations come out.\u201d \n\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Us\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Pratham  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBoard  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLeadership  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPartners  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tPrograms\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEducation  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVocational Training   \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnnual Status of Education Report  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPratham Council For Vulnerable Children  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCovid Response  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLearning Readiness & Catch Up  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLessons from the Pandemic  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tGet Involved\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJob Opportunities  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInternships  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tDelhi Office\t\t\t\t\t\t \nB- 4/59, Safdarjung Enclave\n1st Floor, New Delhi - 110 029\nEmail: info@pratham.org\nContact number: 01141651638\n\n\t\t Mumbai Office \nY.B.

Here are five ways to make EdTech more accessible and engaging for children across the country.

The consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic have been severe and continue to be so. In the midst of it, we need to remember that children and youth are not immune to the tensions around them. Confined to their homes, they are observing both, the situation unfold, as well as their parents and family members grapple with stressors. This can bring with it impatience, discomfort, and stress. In this situation, a positive learning environment and access to engaging activities can greatly help in reducing anxiety and stress. Given that schools are closed and children and teachers are confined to their homes, the government has been pinning its hopes on technology-based, remote learning. Subsequently, EdTech companies have been offering their products based on high production value, interactive nature, and adaptivity. However, this knee-jerk reaction has failed to take into account nuances around access, relevance, and community learning. On one hand, the pandemic, like any other crisis, has highlighted the economic inequalities that exist in India. For example, according to the\u00a02019 TRAI data, rural teledensity stands at 57.59 per 100 inhabitants, in contrast to the urban teledensity, which stands at 160.63. What\u2019s more, wireless internet teledensity in rural India stands at 57.28, as opposed to 156.18 in urban areas. We need all stakeholders in the education sector to be cognisant of this ground reality, so that they can adapt their products and programmes accordingly. This pandemic is going to have a lasting impact, especially for communities that are already marginalised. It is therefore imperative that we create solutions that are able to reach the last mile. On the other, we need to ensure that instead of force-fitting learning into a high-stress period of a child\u2019s life, we make content that is easy to navigate and sparks creativity. Not only could this help reduce anxiety and stress, but it will also help create a learning environment for children. MAKING EDTECH MORE ACCESSIBLE Here are some strategies we can follow to ensure that our EdTech programmes are made accessible to and engaging for everyone who needs them: 1. Explore \u2018outdated\u2019 technologies Access to technology is still a questionable reality in most states of India today. The rural teledensity and wireless teledensity figures indicate the economic disparity between rural and urban communities. This disparity is further skewed with a clear gender bias\u2014fewer females have access to phones or internet than their male counterparts. In such situations, the role of EdTech can be as much to promote \u2018outdated\u2019 technologies as it is to create more sophisticated and innovative ones. There are already examples of state governments curating initiatives so that they can reach as many learners as possible. For example, the Delhi government under its \u2018Mission Buniyad\u2019 initiative is using Interactive Voice Recording\u2014so that parents, siblings, or students can give a missed call to get an audio lesson every alternate day\u2014to the\u00a08,00,000 children\u00a0enrolled in classes 3-8 across government schools. The penetration of technologies such as SMS, audio calls, or even radio is far higher than smartphones, tablets, computers, and internet connections. In the 1990s, India developed effective broadcast education programmes, but we moved past them after\u00a0Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan\u00a0promised universal access to schools. Today, the time is right to revive and reinvigorate those programmes to ensure every child\u2019s right to education. Digital content creators and curators need to be mindful that content that is being disseminated for young children is first reaching parents. They are the customers, and it\u2019s up to them to deliver the resources to the consumers\u2014ie, their children. \u201cKeeping the content simple, in regional languages, and catered to their context is crucial.\u201d Many rural and low-income students are first-generation learners and ensuring that their parents can facilitate instructional courses at home might not be possible. Keeping the content simple, in regional languages, and catered to their context is crucial. They should not feel intimated by the content and should feel welcomed by the approach. For example, the Himachal Pradesh government\u2019s initiative \u2018Har Ghar Pathshala\u2019 to share pre-primary content with anganwadi workers and supervisors is a step in this direction. Every day, video capsules are sent through a common medium such as WhatsApp, highlighting activities that parents can do with their children. Counting\u00a0rotis, classifying vegetables, sequencing steel glasses, or reciting folklore, are educational for toddlers, whilst also being easy to carry out. 3. Develop contextualised content It can be harder to stay engaged in learning, outside of the traditional classroom, and so content needs to be familiar and relatable to students in order to generate engagement. The visuals, sounds, and syntax used are all stimuli that are vital to keep children comfortable and engaged. If children see a village and an environment like their own, and a protagonist similar to themselves, they will be able to connect to the lesson easily. Using this understanding, we at\u00a0Pratham Education Foundation\u00a0created a series of 70 videos that showcased children from villages in Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, and Maharashtra having simple conversations with each other in English. These were scripted to include things such as self-introductions, likes and dislikes, interviews with family members, and so on. The children acting out these conversations could also be seen. When other children were exposed to these videos, they start imitating them\u2014thereby picking up vocabulary and conversational skills. 4. Ensure that you have a \u2018human\u2019 element EdTech initiatives are focusing on reaching the last mile learner and are tracking that reach. And while reach is important, it does not guarantee learning (just as delivering textbooks to students does not guarantee that they will understand what is in them). \u201cJust delivering content will not suffice, its digestion and comprehension depends upon a resilient two-way communication channel.\u201d There is a need for human-centered feedback and follow-up. Checking the delivery of the content, getting user feedback on it, understanding whether children can navigate the product, and mitigating any challenges that they are facing, are key to ensuring that this model works well. Follow-up calls from teachers or facilitators can also make technology-enabled learning a more personalised experience. Having a human voice follow up could facilitate the behavioral change that is needed to support any technology adoption. Just delivering content will not suffice, its digestion and comprehension depends upon a resilient two-way communication channel. 5. If possible, use more than one medium One technology medium or delivery model might not suit everyone. Being creative and using multiple lines of communication or a transmedia approach might be helpful too, especially for younger learners. A broadcast mechanism for the inflow of content and a personalised mechanism for feedback can make the learning experience unique and hybrid. For example,\u00a0\u2018Shaale \u2013 Baharchi \u2013 Shaala\u2019\u00a0an initiative by the Maharashtra government\u2019s Nagpur division has taken this transmedia route to learning. A topic is first introduced and broadcasted through a radio\u00a0Aakashwani\u00a0programme for students and parents to listen in. Follow up SMS/WhatsApp messages linked to the session are then sent to registered parents\u2019 phones. It gives the parents and children the space to explore and embrace learning in whatever way they choose to. Who are we building for? The conventional education system\u2014schools, textbooks, classrooms\u2014has changed. We\u2019ve moved from in-person learning to remote learning but also shifted from school to home, class to family, and teacher to parent. And as education and technology professionals collaborate to support engagement and learning, we need to ensure that we innovate for both, the products we make and who have access to them. At this time, more than ever, it is imperative that the system focus on ensuring opportunities for every child to learn well\u2014in their community, in their language, tailored to their context. \n\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Us\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Pratham  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBoard  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLeadership  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPartners  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tPrograms\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEducation  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVocational Training   \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnnual Status of Education Report  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPratham Council For Vulnerable Children  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCovid Response  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLearning Readiness & Catch Up  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLessons from the Pandemic  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tGet Involved\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJob Opportunities  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInternships  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tDelhi Office\t\t\t\t\t\t \nB- 4/59, Safdarjung Enclave\n1st Floor, New Delhi - 110 029\nEmail: info@pratham.org\nContact number: 01141651638\n\n\t\t Mumbai Office \nY.B.

For example, the Himachal Pradesh government\u2019s initiative \u2018Har Ghar Pathshala\u2019 to share pre-primary content with anganwadi workers and supervisors is a step in this direction. Every day, video capsules are sent through a common medium such as WhatsApp, highlighting activities that parents can do with their children. Counting\u00a0rotis, classifying vegetables, sequencing steel glasses, or reciting folklore, are educational for toddlers, whilst also being easy to carry out. 3. Develop contextualised content It can be harder to stay engaged in learning, outside of the traditional classroom, and so content needs to be familiar and relatable to students in order to generate engagement. The visuals, sounds, and syntax used are all stimuli that are vital to keep children comfortable and engaged. If children see a village and an environment like their own, and a protagonist similar to themselves, they will be able to connect to the lesson easily. Using this understanding, we at\u00a0Pratham Education Foundation\u00a0created a series of 70 videos that showcased children from villages in Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, and Maharashtra having simple conversations with each other in English. These were scripted to include things such as self-introductions, likes and dislikes, interviews with family members, and so on. The children acting out these conversations could also be seen. When other children were exposed to these videos, they start imitating them\u2014thereby picking up vocabulary and conversational skills. 4. Ensure that you have a \u2018human\u2019 element EdTech initiatives are focusing on reaching the last mile learner and are tracking that reach. And while reach is important, it does not guarantee learning (just as delivering textbooks to students does not guarantee that they will understand what is in them). \u201cJust delivering content will not suffice, its digestion and comprehension depends upon a resilient two-way communication channel.\u201d There is a need for human-centered feedback and follow-up. Checking the delivery of the content, getting user feedback on it, understanding whether children can navigate the product, and mitigating any challenges that they are facing, are key to ensuring that this model works well. Follow-up calls from teachers or facilitators can also make technology-enabled learning a more personalised experience. Having a human voice follow up could facilitate the behavioral change that is needed to support any technology adoption. Just delivering content will not suffice, its digestion and comprehension depends upon a resilient two-way communication channel. 5. If possible, use more than one medium One technology medium or delivery model might not suit everyone. Being creative and using multiple lines of communication or a transmedia approach might be helpful too, especially for younger learners. A broadcast mechanism for the inflow of content and a personalised mechanism for feedback can make the learning experience unique and hybrid. For example,\u00a0\u2018Shaale \u2013 Baharchi \u2013 Shaala\u2019\u00a0an initiative by the Maharashtra government\u2019s Nagpur division has taken this transmedia route to learning. A topic is first introduced and broadcasted through a radio\u00a0Aakashwani\u00a0programme for students and parents to listen in. Follow up SMS/WhatsApp messages linked to the session are then sent to registered parents\u2019 phones. It gives the parents and children the space to explore and embrace learning in whatever way they choose to. Who are we building for? The conventional education system\u2014schools, textbooks, classrooms\u2014has changed. We\u2019ve moved from in-person learning to remote learning but also shifted from school to home, class to family, and teacher to parent. And as education and technology professionals collaborate to support engagement and learning, we need to ensure that we innovate for both, the products we make and who have access to them. At this time, more than ever, it is imperative that the system focus on ensuring opportunities for every child to learn well\u2014in their community, in their language, tailored to their context. \n\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Us\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Pratham  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBoard  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLeadership  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPartners  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tPrograms\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEducation  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVocational Training   \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnnual Status of Education Report  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPratham Council For Vulnerable Children  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCovid Response  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLearning Readiness & Catch Up  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLessons from the Pandemic  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tGet Involved\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJob Opportunities  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInternships  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tDelhi Office\t\t\t\t\t\t \nB- 4/59, Safdarjung Enclave\n1st Floor, New Delhi - 110 029\nEmail: info@pratham.org\nContact number: 01141651638\n\n\t\t Mumbai Office \nY.B.

When schools open this year, it will be the most anticipated school opening of all time. Children, parents and teachers are all waiting for that moment. Schools were among the first institutions to shut in India. They shut even before the lockdown. The reopening of schools, therefore, will be a clear announcement that normal routines can restart and the daily schedules of life can resume. Schools can restart in several different ways. It can be \u201cbusiness-as-usual\u201d. Worse, the system can go into an \u201caccelerated\u201d mode, trying to cram in all the things that did not happen since March. But what is needed is a time for welcome and a period for settling down. This is not just any \u201cback-to-school\u201d moment. This school opening should be treated as the start of a brand, new chapter. Children need to reconnect with friends. Schools and students need to get reacquainted. Teachers need time to understand the impact of the long unplanned school closure on where children currently are \u2014 socially, emotionally, and academically. Helping them to settle in and \u201ccatch up\u201d will go a long way towards rebuilding foundations and strengthening basic skills. While urban educated families have been able to support their children\u2019s learning activities through the lockdown period, this has been difficult for many households in slum communities and vast parts of rural India. For primary school children, especially in government schools or in low-cost private schools, school closures may have weakened their ability to read or to do basic arithmetic. For older children, boosting reading and comprehension skills, sharpening communication, and the capability to apply language and math skills to actual texts and problems may be needed. In both cases, putting aside the usual age-grade curriculum and focussing on relevant foundational skills, for a few hours in each school day for the first few months, will be an excellent way to start the school year for 2020. The severe economic blow to many families is already visible and is likely to worsen. In such times of hardship, the already vulnerable and weak become even more disadvantaged. We must closely watch and reach out to children who are \u201cat-risk\u201d. Ensuring continuous and steady attendance in school is a must for a real return to normalcy. Girls in upper primary grades may be especially prone to being pulled out. As adult women seek work in the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act or hunt for other local livelihood options, the pressure on teenage girls to help with household chores is likely to intensify. Years of work to ensure universal elementary education cannot be undone by the Covid-19 crisis. Specifically, I worry about girls who have reached class 7 and 8 but whose academic standing is not strong. Rather than demanding stronger and longer remedies in education, poor parents may be tempted to withdraw such girls from school. We certainly need \u201cbeti padhao\u201d, but more than that we need \u201cbeti padhey\u201d and \u201cpadhtey rahe\u201d. Parents have played a very central role in the lockdown period. Schools must recognize their contribution and support. While the national media has been preoccupied in discussing the pros and cons of on-line education, in the last six weeks, we, in Pratham, have embarked on an interesting adventure. In about 11,000 rural and urban communities across India, we have been sending phone messages to parents with a few activities that children can do that day. We started with WhatsApp messages, but it became clear very quickly that many children do not have access to smartphones. Hence, an entirely new wave of SMS messages was quickly developed and are being delivered daily. Thanks to ongoing relationships in these communities, we are also able to call and talk to parents and children at least once a week. Families send back videos and photos of their children\u2019s handiwork; boys and girls phone us frequently to share their experiences. This two-way communication provides excellent feedback for understanding what children and parents can do together even with simple, sparse instructions. We have learned that parents participate in activities that they can engage with, and that continuous discussion and follow up results in energetic and enthusiastic involvement, even from parents who are not highly educated themselves. Parents play a critical role in their children\u2019s lives; we have seen how the lockdown has led to their active support in children\u2019s learning. Now it will be important to keep parental participation high even after schools open. The year 2020 is not a year for ambitious learning targets; nor is it a year for moving rapidly through what is already recognized as an overambitious curriculum. The new 2020 school year should be spent in reconnecting, settling down, \u201ccatching\u201d up, rebuilding foundations and in enjoying school. We must do this to ensure that our children emerge strong and ready for tackling the 2021-22 school year. \n\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Us\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Pratham  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBoard  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLeadership  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPartners  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tPrograms\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEducation  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVocational Training   \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnnual Status of Education Report  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPratham Council For Vulnerable Children  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCovid Response  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLearning Readiness & Catch Up  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLessons from the Pandemic  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tGet Involved\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJob Opportunities  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInternships  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tDelhi Office\t\t\t\t\t\t \nB- 4/59, Safdarjung Enclave\n1st Floor, New Delhi - 110 029\nEmail: info@pratham.org\nContact number: 01141651638\n\n\t\t Mumbai Office \nY.B.

It appears now that the economy is going to change even more drastically. By Madhav Chavan The original article was published in The Indian Express on April 30, 2020 https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/coronavirus-lockdown-covid-19-pandemic-impact-on-economy-madhav-chavan-6385389/ Schools started shutting down in China in late January and by the last week of March, all the world\u2019s schools were closed. Almost like sunset and sunrise, as the last schools in central African countries stopped working, the Chinese schools began to reopen. Other countries too are opening the doors of their schools cautiously. But there is a great deal of uncertainty in the air everywhere. In India, there are murmurs that schools could remain closed until September or October. And there is the question: What will happen \u201cafter all this is over\u201d? As schools began to shut down in different countries, the immediate reaction was to shift the classroom to homes using whatever technology was possible since people were locked in. There is a lot of thinking, planning, and execution happening in a hurry in every country, including India. Countries or regions or even schools that have more easy access to Internet-devices and learning resources in the appropriate medium of instruction seem to have made the transition to online learning rather quickly although not without some pain. How effective these transitions were and how good the relatively short experience was will have to be analysed not only educationally, but also socially and psychologically. Early reports from China do not paint a rosy picture. Although there are more mobile connections than people in China, only 59 per cent of the mobile connections are with internet and only 47 per cent households in China seem to have PCs or laptops. So, it must have been relatively easy for the Chinese to move to a home-based online learning system, but only for about half the population. I have not seen reports about what happened to the rest, which I suspect live in rural China or are on peripheries of the glittering Chinese economy. In comparison to China, India has about a billion mobile phone connections. Available data indicate that of these, 87 per cent are pre-paid, which gives us a hint about the economic background of the people owning these connections. Of the billion mobile phones, 67 per cent are 3G or 4G internet-connected. Some of these owners also have laptops or desktops at home but they are limited to about 13 per cent households. Our ground-level experience matches with these numbers. In rural areas of Maharashtra, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh although 90 per cent families have mobile phones, depending upon the state, about 40 per cent to 60 per cent of these are regular phones without internet access. So, the Indian population can be divided into several different categories. First, the highly privileged ones with home access to broadband through multiple devices. Second, those with internet access via smart mobile phones. Third, with mobile phones but without internet and finally, those without cell phones. Broadly, this is a problem of 10:40:40:10 division of the population with the ratios varying regionally. In response to this division, various state governments have turned to radio-television technology of the 1980s and \u201890s. They are trying to get teachers and students engaged with educational resources on portals through WhatsApp messages and so on. Most efforts are centred around school subject learning although this is really vacation time. In the best of times, the classroom is not effective as various assessments have shown. How effective these hurriedly put together home-learning efforts will be, especially for the lower 50 per cent, is a big question mark. Will the underprivileged lag further behind? If we are talking about \u201ccompleting the portion\u201d, almost everyone will. But there are bigger problems to consider. These are difficult and stressful times for all. Apart from the discomfort of forced lock-in, there is the anxiety about the future among parents. Children can sense these tensions. I would not worry too much about school examination results during this period. Instead, our focus should be on creative learning activities that engage both children and parents and lead to other long-lasting lessons. Relief is needed, not more stress. Whenever the schools reopen, the sheer relief of going back to schools may also mean there will be the desire to go back to business as usual. But experiences from the shutdown period could be used to modify the education system as we enter a new normal situation. For example, it is observed that wherever less-educated parents have been invited to facilitate their child\u2019s learning, they have shown enthusiasm. Parents of young children today are mostly schooled if not educated and are eager to learn to help their children. Parents\u2019 role in children\u2019s education has to be enhanced by training them in a \u201ccontinuing education\u201d mode. This is especially true for the children in anganwadis and early primary age group where strong foundational skills are learned. Increasing public access to Internet for school-age learning by creating device libraries is a possibility. Investment in the creation of good contextualised content in Indian languages is a need. Integrating technology in education often means creating more attractive audio-visual textbooks that are really one-way carriers of knowledge. There is a need to recognise that the new technology can do much more and create non-linear paths of learning. It is said our economy and our society will not be the same from here on. The need for learning skills that will help to survive and thrive in the new economy was already being discussed before COVID. It appears now that the economy is going to change even more drastically. There will be more people dependent on agriculture and rural livelihoods. We need more productive land resources and more rural livelihoods. A large number of people have returned to villages. Some will go back to old jobs while others will need new skills to find work. The education system has to be sensitive to the immediate needs of the youth as we contemplate long-term reforms. As the economy changes, the need for lifelong learning is becoming more urgent than ever. During the lockdown period, people have learned things that they would never have before. They loved the experience, even if grudgingly. There is going to be individual need to learn new work skills. Our experiences during lockdown are pointing us in the direction of necessary and possible changes. We should reflect on those and act.

If we are talking about \u201ccompleting the portion\u201d, almost everyone will. But there are bigger problems to consider. These are difficult and stressful times for all. Apart from the discomfort of forced lock-in, there is the anxiety about the future among parents. Children can sense these tensions. I would not worry too much about school examination results during this period. Instead, our focus should be on creative learning activities that engage both children and parents and lead to other long-lasting lessons. Relief is needed, not more stress. Whenever the schools reopen, the sheer relief of going back to schools may also mean there will be the desire to go back to business as usual. But experiences from the shutdown period could be used to modify the education system as we enter a new normal situation. For example, it is observed that wherever less-educated parents have been invited to facilitate their child\u2019s learning, they have shown enthusiasm. Parents of young children today are mostly schooled if not educated and are eager to learn to help their children. Parents\u2019 role in children\u2019s education has to be enhanced by training them in a \u201ccontinuing education\u201d mode. This is especially true for the children in anganwadis and early primary age group where strong foundational skills are learned. Increasing public access to Internet for school-age learning by creating device libraries is a possibility. Investment in the creation of good contextualised content in Indian languages is a need. Integrating technology in education often means creating more attractive audio-visual textbooks that are really one-way carriers of knowledge. There is a need to recognise that the new technology can do much more and create non-linear paths of learning. It is said our economy and our society will not be the same from here on. The need for learning skills that will help to survive and thrive in the new economy was already being discussed before COVID. It appears now that the economy is going to change even more drastically. There will be more people dependent on agriculture and rural livelihoods. We need more productive land resources and more rural livelihoods. A large number of people have returned to villages. Some will go back to old jobs while others will need new skills to find work. The education system has to be sensitive to the immediate needs of the youth as we contemplate long-term reforms. As the economy changes, the need for lifelong learning is becoming more urgent than ever. During the lockdown period, people have learned things that they would never have before. They loved the experience, even if grudgingly. There is going to be individual need to learn new work skills. Our experiences during lockdown are pointing us in the direction of necessary and possible changes. We should reflect on those and act.

It appears now that the economy is going to change even more drastically. By Madhav Chavan The original article was published in The Indian Express on April 30, 2020 https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/coronavirus-lockdown-covid-19-pandemic-impact-on-economy-madhav-chavan-6385389/ Schools started shutting down in China in late January and by the last week of March, all the world\u2019s schools were closed. Almost like sunset and sunrise, as the last schools in central African countries stopped working, the Chinese schools began to reopen. Other countries too are opening the doors of their schools cautiously. But there is a great deal of uncertainty in the air everywhere. In India, there are murmurs that schools could remain closed until September or October. And there is the question: What will happen \u201cafter all this is over\u201d? As schools began to shut down in different countries, the immediate reaction was to shift the classroom to homes using whatever technology was possible since people were locked in. There is a lot of thinking, planning, and execution happening in a hurry in every country, including India. Countries or regions or even schools that have more easy access to Internet-devices and learning resources in the appropriate medium of instruction seem to have made the transition to online learning rather quickly although not without some pain. How effective these transitions were and how good the relatively short experience was will have to be analysed not only educationally, but also socially and psychologically. Early reports from China do not paint a rosy picture. Although there are more mobile connections than people in China, only 59 per cent of the mobile connections are with internet and only 47 per cent households in China seem to have PCs or laptops. So, it must have been relatively easy for the Chinese to move to a home-based online learning system, but only for about half the population. I have not seen reports about what happened to the rest, which I suspect live in rural China or are on peripheries of the glittering Chinese economy. In comparison to China, India has about a billion mobile phone connections. Available data indicate that of these, 87 per cent are pre-paid, which gives us a hint about the economic background of the people owning these connections. Of the billion mobile phones, 67 per cent are 3G or 4G internet-connected. Some of these owners also have laptops or desktops at home but they are limited to about 13 per cent households. Our ground-level experience matches with these numbers. In rural areas of Maharashtra, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh although 90 per cent families have mobile phones, depending upon the state, about 40 per cent to 60 per cent of these are regular phones without internet access. So, the Indian population can be divided into several different categories. First, the highly privileged ones with home access to broadband through multiple devices. Second, those with internet access via smart mobile phones. Third, with mobile phones but without internet and finally, those without cell phones. Broadly, this is a problem of 10:40:40:10 division of the population with the ratios varying regionally. In response to this division, various state governments have turned to radio-television technology of the 1980s and \u201890s. They are trying to get teachers and students engaged with educational resources on portals through WhatsApp messages and so on. Most efforts are centred around school subject learning although this is really vacation time. In the best of times, the classroom is not effective as various assessments have shown. How effective these hurriedly put together home-learning efforts will be, especially for the lower 50 per cent, is a big question mark. Will the underprivileged lag further behind?

At Pratham, our first priority was to ensure that our students, teams, and families are staying safe and taking adequate precautions. As you can imagine doing this for the large Pratham network spread-out all-over India was quite daunting. Now we are figuring out how to remain engaged with our communities and students. Information (handouts, posters, videos) on how to take preventive action with regard to safety and hygiene has been shared with all teams in Hindi and in English. All teams have also set up reliable communication channels to share information quickly. Setting up mechanisms that enable us to be in constant touch from remote is also good in the long haul. We had stopped all travel, workshops, and meetings as early as March 5, 2020, but as of March 17, 2020, all our offices and operations across the country have shut down; almost all staff members are at home with their families or now staying in a safe and secure location.\u00a0 For much of Pratham, working from home is a new experience because much of our work is with children, schools, and communities! As always, we remain committed and focussed on ways to remain connected with our children and our communities and stay positive and productive. Our teams have been working quickly to ensure relevant information is available for our people and for the communities we work in. Some resources we have leveraged include WHO videos translated into regional languages (see examples below), and relevant content videos such as this one on handwashing. We have also created COVID-19 response guidelines in Hindi and English for our teams to help them and their communities stay healthy and out of harm\u2019s way.In this challenging time, we must come together and continue to drive ideas and innovation to help our children and communities engage and stay informed.

Young 1ove is committed to scaling-up health and education programs backed by rigorous evidence. \nThe first time we saw Pratham in action was in Zambia in June 2016. We were attending one of the first trainings Pratham had ever conducted in Africa. Usha Rane and Meera Tendolkar were the head trainers, both long-time Pratham leaders, and sisters, whose motherly affection captured the room instantly. The room was cramped, filled with dozens of government officials committed to improving basic literacy and numeracy skills for their students. Pratham was training on Teaching at the Right Level (TaRL). TaRL is an approach to teach basic literacy and numeracy through fun activities targeted to the level of each child. For example, reading a word or doing 2-digit addition, rather than teaching to a uniform grade-level curriculum. The program has been evaluated for over 15 years by the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL) at MIT and shown to be one of the most cost-effective ways to improve learning. Thato Letsomo, our training manager, and Noam Angrist, our co-founder, left the training with over 20 activities buzzing in their heads, a bit unsure on where to start, but inspired to do something. So, we did. We conducted an assessment, a census in two regions, to see if the program was needed in Botswana. The findings showed a pressing need: 90 percent of students could not do 2-digit division in grade 5, and 40 percent could not read a simple story. With a clear need identified and motivated to act, we partnered with the Ministry of Basic Education and UNICEF. In the last few years, we have reached 10% of primary schools in Botswana. The results have been striking: In the most recent term, almost 70% of students learned to do division just 30 days into the program. Since the first initial trip to Zambia, Pratham has twice visited Botswana to support our scale-up effort with the government. We have also partnered with Pratham and J-PAL to be an innovation hub for an Africa-wide scale-up effort supported by Co-Impact. But we had not been to India. In November 2019, supported by the People\u2019s Action for Learning network, we jumped at the opportunity to see Pratham on their home turf where Teaching at the Right Level was born and developed over decades. We weren\u2019t sure exactly what we were going to learn \u2014 we had already been trained, supported, had been in the implementation trenches for three years and seen strong results \u2014 but we knew we would learn something. \nThe trip started with a flight from Nepal where we had attended the People\u2019s Action for Learning network conference. Rukmini Banerji, Pratham\u2019s CEO, Wilima Wadhwa, the Director of the ASER Center, the sister organization of Pratham that conducts large-scale learning assessments across India, Thato and Noam flew to Delhi together. After a brief flight delay \u2014 which we took advantage of to hop out of the airport and eat a delicious lunch in Kathmandu \u2014 we arrived in Delhi, where our colleagues Moitshepi Matsheng, Young 1ove\u2019s co-founder and the chair of the Botswana government\u2019s National Youth Council, and Sunshine Ntshambiwa, a Young 1ove training guru, met up for an action-packed 10-day trip. A warm welcome  \nWe met with Sarvendra Vikram Singh, a senior government official in the department of education in Uttar Pradesh. He had recently overseen a rollout of Teaching at the Right Level to over 8 million children in hundreds of thousands of schools. He was so invested that he had sent direct messages to teachers implementing the program to show he was paying attention and cared. The program was now slowing down, due to reforms being rolled out, but Pratham and the Uttar Pradesh government had seized the opportunity to massively scale-up and countless lives had been changed for the better. When we shared that Botswana had 750 primary schools in total, he looked at us with a smile, and asked, \u2018Why are you not already in all of them?\u2019 We spent time in schools in urban areas in Lucknow and the rural villages of Uttar Pradesh, followed by more field visits in Nagpur. Students sat in circles on the floor, alongside friendly instructors, including teachers and young volunteers. Each student\u2019s eyes were wide and fingers pointed along to number and word problems scribbled all across the room. Noam joins students \u2018at the right level\u2019 \nSeeing teaching at the right level where it was born, with nearly every child hyper-engaged in the learning progress, made it look easy. But having just started to rollout teaching at the right level in Botswana, we could appreciate just how hard it must have been to have achieve such a seismic shift from the status quo in the education system. In Botswana, when we asked students to sit on the floor, we had to send letters home to each and every parent to ensure students packed extra clothes to change out of their uniforms. In order to convince instructors to sit on the floor with students and let the child speak more than the teacher, we had to convince them first to practice delivering the program, to appreciate the magic of doing things differently. \nWe had to get large-scale community buy-in to eliminate corporal punishment so students were not fearful of being wrong and were comfortable revealing when they didn\u2019t understand a concept \u2013 after all, you can only teach at the right level if you know the right level. Once corporal punishment vanished, the students were free, but little learning was taking place as the students treated the classroom like an indoor playground. So we introduced positive behavioral management strategies, such as call and responses and instructional song and dance, to combine learning and fun. We even tried some tricks of the trade in India. While it was hard to make all of these things happen, once we did, it worked. And that was the most remarkable thing of all \u2013 worlds and cultures apart, our students in Botswana and the students in India were similar: With a dose of targeted, playful, instruction, their eyes lit up as they relished the opportunity to receive a quality education. \nIn schools in Nagpur, we were accompanied by Usha who introduced us to the district commissioner, school management, and joined us in the classroom. In the middle of a riveting TaRL session, Usha noticed one of the math problems was too hard. She immediately sent a Whatsapp message to headquarters. That\u2019s Pratham \u2013\u2013 even the most senior leaders are deeply connected to the day-to-day learning process. We are obsessed with helping kids learn ever better, unsatisfied with their already research-backed, Nobel-worthy, world-class results. In each city and village we visited, we had the opportunity to meet staff who had been with Pratham for decades. They beamed with pride as they shared their Pratham journey. Somraj Giradkar, state head in Maharashtra, has been with Pratham for over 16 years, starting as a volunteer, then leading a district, a division and being promoted to state head in 2012. Sunshine, Thato, Tshepi, Sam and Usha appreciate learning materials in the school \nEvery organization is an amalgamation of its people, and the Pratham team members we met were leaders of practice in every sense of the word \u2014 expert, inspiring, and committed. We also met Shobini Mukerji, Executive Director of J-PAL South Asia, and her team, including Harini Kannan and Meghna Pradhan. Shobini and Harini had been directly involved in multiple Teaching at the Right Level randomized trials. We got their take, including the breakthrough trial where the government education system delivered the intervention at scale with strong learning outcomes. Key features included government leaders conducting practice classes directly and dedicated coaching support. The symbiotic relationship between J-PAL and Pratham, and thus between research and large-scale action, was palpable. Shobini herself had worked at Pratham before leading the J-PAL South Asia office. Thato, Noam and Devyani join the\u00a0 ECD program \nIn addition to seeing Teaching at the Right Level in action, we saw many other Pratham programs. Devyani Pershad, head of International Collaborations, showed us Pratham\u2019s newest PraDigi platform for digital self-teaching in remote areas using tablets, and their early childhood development (ECD) programs delivered in government Anganwadi centers. While each program was unique, there were striking similarities. The ECD program has an assessment tool to enable targeted instruction and closely track results on a continual basis. Pratham facilitators worked hand-in-hand with government leaders in a public-private model that married innovation with scale. \nBeyond the work, we enjoyed food and reflections with the Pratham leadership team. Over lunch with Samyukta Lakshman and Manushi Yadav, we reflected on India\u2019s history and explored ancient forts. Rukmini gifted us kurtas, which we duly wore to a laugh-filled dinner at Devyani\u2019s home. Usha dashed to the market one evening after a packed day of meetings with senior government officials and school visits to ensure we had stylish scarves. We enjoyed delicious dal over dinner with Rukmini and Madhav Chavan, co-founder of Pratham. A few days later, once the lentils had digested, Madhav pushed us: Why not scale faster? \nOur greatest takeaway from the trip ties directly to that question. We saw with our own eyes Pratham\u2019s vast reach, and an organizational DNA that had cultivated scalability. Pratham is committed for the long haul and develops leaders of practice from within over decades. Pratham has seized and adapted to opportunities rather than followed a linear, staged path, in the form of state government rollouts to millions when the time was ripe, and ambassadors who set up Pratham chapters almost entirely on their own accord. Devyani, Rukmini, Manushi, Thato, Samyukta, Sunshine and Noam Sunshine, Noam, Madhav, Thato & Moitshepi \nIn a sense, this approach is consistent with the philosophy of Teaching at the Right Level \u2013 rather than follow a curriculum, better to adapt to each and every situation and seize the moment. Rather than carbon copy a standardized package, Pratham\u2019s leaders spread seeds with a common fiber, observe where they start to sprout, and water the soil until the flowers bloom. Our biggest takeaways from our trip to India weren\u2019t programmatic; they were organizational. We saw how Pratham is, in the truest sense, a family, bursting with passion, hearty debate, and a life-long commitment, in schools and at the dinner table. Second, Pratham \u2014 one of the largest education organizations in India \u2014 is in fact not an organization, it\u2019s a movement. We\u2019re excited to have joined it. Now, it\u2019s time we reach all schools in Botswana, and beyond. \n\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Us\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Pratham  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBoard  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLeadership  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPartners  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tPrograms\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEducation  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVocational Training   \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnnual Status of Education Report  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPratham Council For Vulnerable Children  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCovid Response  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLearning Readiness & Catch Up  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLessons from the Pandemic  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tGet Involved\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJob Opportunities  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInternships  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tDelhi Office\t\t\t\t\t\t \nB- 4/59, Safdarjung Enclave\n1st Floor, New Delhi - 110 029\nEmail: info@pratham.org\nContact number: 01141651638\n\n\t\t Mumbai Office \nY.B.

Young 1ove is committed to scaling-up health and education programs backed by rigorous evidence. \nThe first time we saw Pratham in action was in Zambia in June 2016. We were attending one of the first trainings Pratham had ever conducted in Africa. Usha Rane and Meera Tendolkar were the head trainers, both long-time Pratham leaders, and sisters, whose motherly affection captured the room instantly. The room was cramped, filled with dozens of government officials committed to improving basic literacy and numeracy skills for their students. Pratham was training on Teaching at the Right Level (TaRL). TaRL is an approach to teach basic literacy and numeracy through fun activities targeted to the level of each child. For example, reading a word or doing 2-digit addition, rather than teaching to a uniform grade-level curriculum. The program has been evaluated for over 15 years by the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL) at MIT and shown to be one of the most cost-effective ways to improve learning. Thato Letsomo, our training manager, and Noam Angrist, our co-founder, left the training with over 20 activities buzzing in their heads, a bit unsure on where to start, but inspired to do something. So, we did. We conducted an assessment, a census in two regions, to see if the program was needed in Botswana. The findings showed a pressing need: 90 percent of students could not do 2-digit division in grade 5, and 40 percent could not read a simple story.

Here is a glimpse of the learning journeys and lives of some of the children surveyed in ASER 2019. \n\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Us\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Pratham  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBoard  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLeadership  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPartners  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tPrograms\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEducation  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVocational Training   \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnnual Status of Education Report  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPratham Council For Vulnerable Children  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCovid Response  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLearning Readiness & Catch Up  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLessons from the Pandemic  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tGet Involved\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJob Opportunities  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInternships  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tDelhi Office\t\t\t\t\t\t \nB- 4/59, Safdarjung Enclave\n1st Floor, New Delhi - 110 029\nEmail: info@pratham.org\nContact number: 01141651638\n\n\t\t Mumbai Office \nY.B.

She shares snapshots from the visit and reflections on the Catch Up programme. The teacher was telling a story. It was a story from her own childhood; about a morning when she over- slept and missed the right time to go to school and the adventures that followed as she tried to rush to get there. Children sat around in a circle listening to her. With eyes wide open, they intently followed her voice and her gestures. Outside, the warm afternoon breeze blew through the trees and over the red soil. We were in Kazungula district, not far from the Zambezi river in the southern province of Zambia. This was a \u201cCatch Up\u201d class in a primary school. In Zambia, the Ministry of Basic Education is running a programme to help children in Grades 3, 4 and 5 who have not yet learned to read or are struggling with basic arithmetic. Based on an approach called Teaching at the Right Level [LINK] developed originally in India by Pratham [LINK], the foundational literacy-numeracy \u201cCatch Up\u201d initiative is being implemented by government schoolteachers in the Eastern and Southern provinces of Zambia. Children across the three grades are grouped by their current learning levels rather than by their grade. Teachers worked with the different groups using variety of games and activities that have been systematically designed to enable children to become fluent readers and confident with basic arithmetic skills. Children work in big groups, then break into smaller groups to practice and often do quick individual activities as well. These combined activities seem to help them progress quickly. Soon, they move into the next group and the next group until almost everyone is in the top-most group. We were with a group of children who could read words and were now learning to read sentences. The teacher had finished her story and moved on to the next activity. Now every child had a short text in front of them. The teacher read the paragraph out aloud. Children followed, their fingers moving in the book from one word to the next as she read. Soon, children were sounding out words. Some took their time; some could read more fluently. But everyone was making progress slowly or quickly from words to sentences to short paragraphs. The District Education of Kazungula took us through the district\u2019s journey. (Kazungula is one of the 27 districts in Zambia implementing Catch Up.) In 2018, 20 schools in Kazungula district participated in Catch Up. The results were promising. In 2019, 75 additional schools joined the program. The results not only remained good but actually got better. In Kazungula, children reading fluently moved from 31 percentage at baseline to 51% by endline. Similar improvements in arithmetic were visible as well. The assistant District Resource Centre Coordinator looked into his notebook. \u201cIn the baseline in 2019, we had 3,766 children who could not even read letters. By midline this number was at 1,672 and by endline there were about 1,000 children left in this category.\u201d \u201cThe terrain is tough, the district is understaffed, villages are remote and hard to reach, transport is difficult\u201d, explained the District Secretary. \u201cBut we are still making progress.\u201d \u201cWhat is the secret of this progress\u201d we asked. \u201cWhat is happening now that was not happening before?\u201d The district government team offered many thoughts. \u201cThe training had many people in a group and so perhaps they did not all get the entire approach. Visiting schools after training we could see the gaps so retraining sessions were done in smaller groups, zones clustered together,\u201d said the assistant District Resource Centre Coordinator. The District Secretary felt that \u201cif you get the basics then that is foundation of education\u201d. Finding time to focus on core foundational skills was essential. Another district officer pointed to motivation \u2013 \u201cThe secretary comes to each training to speak directly to the teachers.\u201d Something is happening all the time, communication goes out to schools, time is important, mentorship is important. The district coordinator from VVOB-education for development, the organisation supporting the programme in this and other districts pointed to the fact that \u201call master trainers conducted 20 days of practice themselves and tasted success from seeing how their children progressed. Once this happened helping and inspiring teachers was easy\u201d. The teacher wrote a sentence on the blackboard. She turned to the class and asked them to read it. One child read the words loudly. Others laughed as they listened. The sentence was not correct. So, now what needs to be done? The sentence needs to be fixed. One boy went up to the blackboard and rearranged the words so that the sentence read correctly. The teacher wrote another sentence \u2026 again the children jumped up and down raising their hands. They love correcting mistakes. Don\u2019t forget, these are children who can read words and are just learning to read sentences. Yes, they have a lot to say. The teacher stood back. She has a shy smile, but it was a proud and victorious smile. Her children were well on their way to success. We are back in the district office. The District Secretary welcomes us back warmly. He tells us of a review meeting towards the end of last year where progress of children in all districts was discussed. \u201cWe were left smiling,\u201d he says. \u201cKazungula was right up there\u201d. Now his voice drops dramatically. \u201cWe have to strive to remain up there\u201d. This is a beginning. There is still a lot of work to be done. Change is possible. Very possible. There is instant feedback from the children. Things are happening all the time. Confidence and capability are building day by day. In the class, in the school and at the district level, the goal is clear. The basic foundations have to be built and then there is no end to what children will be able to do. \u201cWhat about the thousand children who are still at beginner level?\u201d The district team members smile. Just like the teacher in the school, their smiles are warm, confident and determined. One of them replies. \u201cAt the soonest!!!\u201d Rukmini Banerji Originally published on the TaRL Africa blog:\u00a0\u00a0https://www.teachingattherightlevel.org/catching-up-in-kazungula/ \n\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Us\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Pratham  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBoard  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLeadership  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPartners  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tPrograms\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEducation  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVocational Training   \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnnual Status of Education Report  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPratham Council For Vulnerable Children  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCovid Response  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLearning Readiness & Catch Up  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLessons from the Pandemic  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tGet Involved\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJob Opportunities  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInternships  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tDelhi Office\t\t\t\t\t\t \nB- 4/59, Safdarjung Enclave\n1st Floor, New Delhi - 110 029\nEmail: info@pratham.org\nContact number: 01141651638\n\n\t\t Mumbai Office \nY.B.

To counter such superstitions and generate scientific curiosity among people, especially children, Pratham\u2019s Science Program team designed many activities around the last solar eclipse of the decade, which was visible from India on the 26th of December 2019. The series of activities generated immense excitement among one and all. An annular solar eclipse, where the moon appears completely surrounded by the Sun called the Ring of Fire, was visible from some parts of southern India. The rest of India witnessed a partial solar eclipse. We distributed 58,000 solar filters and reached approximately 190,000 people across 18 states, spanning different programs. Staying indoors or not eating anything during the eclipse are some of the known myths. Hence, breaking these myths and encouraging the community to witness the event was a significant task. At most of the locations Pratham teams and volunteers spread awareness and explained the phenomenon of an eclipse. Most of the activities in the hybrid learning program in 2019 were anchored through a \u2018Coach\u2019 \u2013 a young member in the village (between ages 14-18 years or above). Many of these coaches have been students of the hybrid-learning intervention. Over the year, they facilitated several activities in the villages \u2013 starting from assessments, to helping children resolve doubts, and push data on to the server. This time, the coaches went a step ahead and broke a lot of barriers by helping the children in the community witness the solar eclipse. Dealing with the superstition around the eclipse, generating curiosity among children and helping them spread the message of science \u2013 were all part of the training we conducted for 1000 coaches. The energy was at its peak since the beginning. In the preparation stage, the coaches participated with full force. One coach from each hybrid-learning village was trained in the various aspects of the eclipse. We gave every coach five solar filters and trained them in its usage. Moreover, the coaches were made familiar with the nuances of the eclipse through models and role-plays. After the training, the coaches trained\u00a0children in the village, got them ready and also spoke to the villagers. They taught around 60,000 children who witnessed the annular solar eclipse. Through Pratham\u2019s Science program, a series of messages were circulated via social media a week before the eclipse. The message was to address the myths associated with the eclipse, and also inform people how they could view an eclipse. In addition to this, a manual was developed with a variety of activities and translated in multiple Indian languages. The students of our Second Chance program also experienced the event. In Rajasthan, one of our tutors, who is pregnant, was not ready to experience the eclipse due to the associated superstitions. \u00a0However, she participated in our discussion and was finally convinced that an eclipse is a natural phenomenon and an opportunity which she should not miss!

Even the highway is choked, caused by the traffic lights that have been erected. When Tara was little, the stories were little too. But now she is a big girl. She reads a lot. She finishes fat books in a day. She writes long-long stories herself. Tara loves stories and books very much. Now, you tell me, what kind of story would be best for such a reader and writer? Learning from the experiences and evidence generated, Pratham modified and adapted mother engagement efforts in the early childhood space by forming groups of mothers in the neighborhood.

For the first time, a number was put to status of basic learning in the country. ASER is linked with a constructive satyagraha to insist on the right of the citizens to participate in the functioning of the government. We believe that good work done by governments, and there is a lot of it, deserves to be applauded. But governments must also take outcome oriented steps to improve performance of schools. ASER 2006 records that the proportion of out of school children has not diminished. They are entering formal schooling one year too early and older children are in lower classes in large numbers. Read here for more findings.  ASER 2007 presents data on school enrollment, learning levels and comprehension skills, among others. This is the fourth year of ASER and this unique survey of the status of learning in rural India has become a much awaited report for policy makers. Are Private schools really performing better than government schools? ASER survey has the answers. Find the details here ASER 2010 reported a substantial increase in school enrolment figures but no visible improvement in the quality of education. ASER 2011 found that private school enrollment in most states is increasing although the Right to Education Act for free and compulsory education is in place. Over 25% children in rural India go to private schools and the numbers are likely to rise.  \u201d ASER 2012 noted that levels of reading and math at every level were not only poor but\ndeclining in many states. \u201c \n\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Us\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout Pratham  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBoard  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLeadership  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPartners  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tPrograms\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEducation  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVocational Training   \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnnual Status of Education Report  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPratham Council For Vulnerable Children  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCovid Response  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLearning Readiness & Catch Up  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLessons from the Pandemic  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tGet Involved\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJob Opportunities  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInternships  \n\t\t\t\t\t\tDelhi Office\t\t\t\t\t\t \nB- 4/59, Safdarjung Enclave\n1st Floor, New Delhi - 110 029\nEmail: info@pratham.org\nContact number: 01141651638\n\n\t\t Mumbai Office \nY.B.
